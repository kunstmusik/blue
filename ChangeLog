> Notes for 2.7.2 <
[release 2017.xx.xx]

NEW

* BlueSynthBuilder:

  * Knob - added Label, Label Font, and Label Enabled property. Label text is
  centered above knob in UI. Default is label to be shown, but older projects
  will load without label shown for backwards compatibility.

  * Ctrl-v keyboard shortcut will now paste copies of the last copied widgets 
  at an offset from the originals. 

* Issue #372 - Added note to documentation about Debian/Ubuntu Linux install
  instructions for JavaFX

* ObjectBuilder - Added JavaScript and Clojure language options; modified editor
  to use Combo Box to choose language(replaces "External" checkbox)

UPDATED

* BlueSynthBuilder: Program now always rescales values when updating min/max 
  properties for UI elements (e.g., Knob, Slider). (Removes need for popup 
  dialog for every time user modifies min/max.)


FIX

* Issue #368 - When double-clicking PolyObject in project SoundObject Library,
  Score editor now shows timeline of PolyObject and updates navigation bar

* Mixer: Right-clicking on subchannels to remove made easier by allowing 
  clicking on labels

* Code Editor: fixed errors and exceptions when choosing an auto-completion for
  opcode or BSBWidget name 


INTERNAL

* Support for Csound 5 API removed


> Notes for 2.7.1 <
[release 2017.09.24]

FIX

* BlueSynthBuilder - UI Editor would hang on OSX when setting Min/Max values on
  widgets due to JavaFX/Swing UI threads interactions; replaced Swing code to 
  with JFX code in affected areas


> Notes for 2.7.0 <
[release 2017.09.22]

NEW

* BlueSynthBuilder:
  * GUI editor (shared by ObjectBuilder and Sound SoundObject) rewritten using
    JavaFX UI toolkit
  * Issue #344 - Ability to hide/show value display added to Knob, Sliders, and 
    SliderBanks
  * Issue #312 - Added Group widget that allows grouping of widgets into a
	panel that has a titled border around it for better organization of UI
  * Issue #360 - Visual resizing of widgets implemented with UI Editor using
    resize handles

* RhinoInstrument and RhinoObject were renamed as JavaScriptInstrument and
  JavaScriptObject

* JavaScriptObject now supports "Process on Load" option

* Issue #348 - Implemented Automation tab for Sound soundObject (allows 
  automating any widget within SoundObject interface; automation is edited 
  within Sound's editor window and scales to the duration of the Sound); also
  added Comments fields for Sound and ObjectBuilder objects

* Issue #342 - Program-wide User SoundObject Library
  * Implemented new Program-wide User SoundObject Library. Library is available
    as part of the SoundObjectLibrary window. User can use popup menu to copy
    and paste SoundObjects into folders and add/remove folders.

* Issue #343 - User-defined Opcodes: 
  * Export: User can now select single UDO from project UDO list and choose 
    export to either Blue UDO file (an XML representation of the UDO with 
    .blueUDO extension) or Csound UDO file (standard Csound UDO code in a file 
    with .udo extension)

  * Import: Removed older network-based Import system and added file-based UDO
    import from either Blue UDO (.blueUDO) files or Csound files (.udo, .csd, 
    .orc).  For Csound files, Blue will import all found UDOs within the file.

* Issue #354 - Added "Refresh Folder" popup menu option to refresh Blue File
  Manager folder node

* Issue #355 - Added default layer heights to Program Options->Project Defaults;
  added default layer height as property for AudioLayerGroups

* Issue #357 - Added maintenance of dialog size/location when Generating CSD to
  Screen

* examples/techniques/pvoc2.blue added that shows similar concept as pvoc.blue 
  but uses Sound soundObject and its new automation tab

* Issue #358 - SoundObjects can now be shared on BlueShare

UPDATED

* Mixer:
  * Issue #256 - Pushing up or down effects should keep the same effect selected

  * Issue #257 - Select effect when right-clicking pre or post effects so that 
    popup menu reflects operation on where clicked 

* Renamed RhinoObject and RhinoInstrument to JavaScriptObject and
  JavaScriptInstrument to better reflect their purpose

* JavaScriptObject: for errors/exceptions, now shows error in dialog when 
  rendering project

* BSB widgets and Automation parameters that used resolution argument (i.e., 
  sliders) now use BigDecimal for more precise value generation and faster 
  calculation when automated

* Issue #349 - Revisited score text parsing to speed up; affects parsing of 
  things like GenericScore text, output from Externals (e.g., CMask scripts,
  AthenaCL code)

* Issue #350 - Added value display enabled property to BSBXYController

FIX

* BlueSynthBuilder/ObjectBuilder/Effects - Fixed code completion for BSBWidgets 

* Mixer - using "Edit Effect" to edit the definition of an effect within the 
  mixer would cause an exception after closing the editor

* Reworked visual rendering and setting of BSB widget values when resolution
  property used

* BlueLive - fixed problem where BlueLive would send n copies of each note where
  n = number of times BlueLive was started/stopped (problem due to not clearing
  bindings between runs) 

* JMask - Probability: Beta editor was not showing when Beta generator selected

* Issue #352 - MIDI import was not updated correctly newer ScoreLayer system,
  also, velocity was not processed correctly yielding only zeros

* Issue #337 - Fixed Mixer generation when no instruments found in Orchestra; 
  condition appears when using only Sound SoundObjects in project

* Unfreezing Frozen SoundObjects caused stack overflow due to typo in code, 
  resulting in effect of disappearing SoundObject 

* "Custom" popup menu option that shows code repository options did not function
  correctly 

* Fixed Code Repository Dialog to ensure it is in sync with repository changes.
  Also fixed drag/drop when editing repository within dialog.

* Issue #345 - Parsing output from nGen revealed issue with parsing score 
  statements that were not i- or comments (notes would repeat)

* Automation menu for selecting which parameter to automated did not always size 
  width correctly

INTERNAL

* Replaced use of Cloneable and Serializable with copy constructors and new 
  DeepCopyable interface for all project data models

* Replaced all uses of float with double


> Notes for 2.6.1 <
[release 2016.08.30]

NEW

* Issue #292: added open file handling for Windows and Linux. (Was unable to get 
  it working with OSX unfortunately.) On Windows and Linux, users can 
  right-click on a .blue document and configure Blue to open the file.  Once the
  association is made, users can double-click .blue files to open them in Blue.

* Issue #55: Resize Soundobjects from left-side to adjust start and duration.
  (This was implemented in 2.6.0 as part of Score internal redesign work but the
  issue was not seen until after release.) 

* ProjectPlugins - new plugin system for Project-level editors that can save 
  data with Blue project and can participate in the project lifecycle.  

* Clojure Project Plugin - project-level plugin that adds a new Clojure tab to
  the Project Properties editor and allows setting Clojure library dependencies. 
  Uses Chas Emerick's Pomegranate plugin to download direct and transitive 
  dependencies from Clojars or Maven Central. Useful for using libraries within
  Blue projects. Libraries are set using coordinates and version strings, much 
  as one would with Leiningen-based projects. For example, one may use: 

  kunstmusik/score 0.3.0

  to use my Score library for generating and processing note lists.  

* Issue #148 - Clojure REPL - new Clojure REPL window tied into the synthesized
  namespace created for each project.  User can test and diagnose code that has
  been entered into the namespace (e.g., if a function is defined in a 
  ClojureObject, one can test it from the REPL)

* Issue #309: Added 'alsaseq' driver to list of options in Blue's Realtime 
  Render Settings and added input/output discovery code. 

* Added Steven Yi's "Transit" to the examples/pieces/stevenYi folder

* Issue #331 - Added Cut and Copy actions to popup for PianoRoll when 
  right-clicking selected notes; added Paste menu when right-clicking on 
  canvas and notes exist in the copy buffer

* Issue #272 - Added a confirmation dialog when deleting UserInstrumentLibrary 
  folder

UPDATED

* Updated included Clojure version to 1.8.0

* Issue #149 - implemented cut/copy/paste for PianoRoll for multiple notes, as
  well as shared copy buffer to allow pasting copy/pasting between PianoRolls

* Issue #322 - pressing ctrl when moving mouse points will limit point 
  modification only to the initial direction for line edit panels (i.e, 
  automations, tempo, etc.).

* Automation Parameters - Single-Line Mode Editing Updates
  * When the selection marquee is shown, holding down ctrl when press/dragging 
    will allow modifying just the horizontal locations of the points 
  * When marquee is selected, left-clicking outside the marquee will disable the
    marquee as before, but will not also add an additional point
  * fixed issue when right-clicking a point to delete it that the popup menu
    would also appear

FIX

* Adding new AudioLayerGroups did not properly handle change listening, 
  resulting in NullPointerExceptions when trying to automate parameters on new 
  AudioLayers added to a project.  (This problem only occurred when the 
  AudioLayerGroup and AudioLayer was first added and did not present when 
  loading an existing project or switching to another project and back again.)  

* Issue #332 - "All" file filter did not properly allow all files

* Issue #324 - (Potentially) fixed intermittent look and feel issue where 
  sometimes tabs were not styled correctly

* Issue #248 - partial fix to respect Automations when auditioning SoundObjects.
  Auditioning is guaranteed only to work correctly with top-level SoundObjects.
  (Issue #333 filed to continue looking into this once Blue 3.0 internal changes
  are in place.)


> Notes for 2.6.0 <
[release 2016.07.29]

NEW

* AudioLayers: Initial release. New LayerGroup type for working with AudioFiles 
  strictly by GUI. Each Audio Layer is bound to a mixer channel. Use is modeled
  after common DAW idioms for working with audio clips.

  configured in program options for disk render to open the rendered file after
  rendering (e.g., render and open with Audacity)

* BlueSynthBuilder: added new BSBValue object that has a default value and may
  be automated; the widget only appears during edit mode and is hidden during
  performance mode

UPDATED

* Sound - modified to use BlueSynthBuilder object as backing instrument. Extends 
  single-use instrument idea of previous Sound object to work with an interface 
  modifiable in realtime, similar to Kyma-style objects.

* Added "Paste BSB as Sound" action to score timeline popup menu to paste a BSB
  Object from the copy buffer into the Score as a Sound soundObject

* BlueSynthBuilder - Replaced Knob with new style implemented with JavaFX

  Blue.

* restored loading of all URLs to external browser now that Netbeans 7.4 IDE 
  cluster removed dependency on debugger module

* Made using trackpad or scroll wheel on layer panels (left-hand side) scroll  
  both the layer panels and the main content areas (implemented in main Score
  editor, PatternsObject editor)

  from the Help menu to go to the issue tracker at GitHub 
  (http://www.github.com/kunstmusik/blue/issues)

* Mixer: 

  * Reworked layout of channel panels to be more compact

  * Double-click to edit ChannelList names as well as Channel names (for those
  channels and lists that support it)

  * Updated mixer generation code to use "+=" and "*=" for easier to read 
  output and better performance when running Csound multicore

* Changed "Tools->.csoundrc Editor" to "Tools->.csound6rc Editor", to edit 
  .csound6rc instead of older .csoundrc

* Issue #287 - added name of effect in generated CSD as part of generated UDO
  for effect

* Added MenuScroller for Automation menus (MenuScroller by Daryll Burke:
  https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/menu-scroller/)

FIX

* Redid font/theme handling so that --fontsize flag is respected (can be given
  at commandline or put into blue/etc/blue.conf)

* Fixed issue where after adding a new layer to a LayerGroup, if multiple empty
  layers existed, the new layer would not function properly to show score object
  changes 

* Prevent resizing of Score Objects from left-hand side to have 0 duration when
  snap is enabled

* Issue #250 - setting minimum and maximum for BSB Knobs did not update the knob
  view location when using truncate option

* Audited score timeline actions for undoability

* Issue #258 - fixed "Follow the Leader" ScoreObject action

* Issue #280 - Print out command line used to Output window when rendering to 
  disk 

* Rendering to disk with commandline runner would freeze up until process 
  completed when render job canceled, instead of stopping render job

* Issue #249 - Fixed editing of last automation and tempo point in popup "Edit
  Points" dialog

* Issue #259 - Fixed forwarding of key events from Effects dialogs to main 
  window, so users can now us shortcuts for rendering and other menu shortcuts
  while editing effects

* Issue #270 - User Instrument Library and Arrangement Panel should share the 
  same copy buffer for copying/pasting instruments between the two panels

* Issue #285 - Generating Realtime CSD to Screen did not correctly set if API
  version of CSD should be generated or not  

* Issue #273 - Dragging instrument from library to project should copy, not move

* Issue #306 - Fixed BSB interface not updating after setting values from preset

* Automations - adjusted menu to show "More..." sub-menus when there are more 
  automations available than can fit on the screen

* When generating instruments that use <INSTR_ID> or <INSTR_NAME>, fixed that 
  generated always-on instruments use the ID/name of the original instrument 
  rather than the generated one 

* Redid BlueLive trigger mechanism to use sample-accurate, synchronous 
  processing of time for repeats to remove jitter

* Windows: Fixed trackpad scrolling 

* Fixed BSB parameter var name generation when project has >= 1000 params

* Issue #267 - reset BSB Object property sheet when setting automation enabled
  is cancelled

* Issue #255 - fixed Automatable BSB objects that did not update parameters 
  correctly when objectName was changed

* Issue #251 - fixed issue where copy/pasted BSBFileSelector would not update
  correctly within Csound even though UI was updating

INTERNAL

* Changed Blue plugin registration to use Annotations (@SoundObjectPlugin, 
  @InstrumentPlugin, @NoteProcessorPlugin)

* Refactored all ScoreTimeline actions into separate Action classes; shortcut 
  registration now done declaratively 


>Notes for 2.5.14<
[release 2014.05.13]

FIX

* Note parsing failed when a comment was the last item in a score block

* Time pointer was not showing when using Commandline runner


>Notes for 2.5.13<
[release 2014.04.21]

FIX

* Generating a CSD or rendering to disk was not using the correct CSD
generator, causing automations not to be rendered.


>Notes for 2.5.12<
[release 2014.04.11]

FIX

* Freezing SoundObjects was using the wrong settings (realtime settings);
fixed to use disk render settings


>Notes for 2.5.11<
[release 2014.04.10]

UPDATED/FIX

* Rewrote score parser for much better speed and greatly reduced memory 
  requirements

* Replaced score expression evaluator with exp4j for better performance

FIX

* When using the Csound API, set --env:SFDIR=/path/to/csd so that things like
fout will write output relative to the directory where the .blue/.csd is used


>Notes for 2.5.10<
[release 2014.02.11]

NEW

* Added BlueLive sub-menu to the Project menu to have menu options in addition
  to the Toolbar 

FIX

* Bug #87/94: Automations were not getting cleared correctly from the timeline 
  when disabled in a BSB Widget due to bad index code


>Notes for 2.5.9<
[release 2014.01.21]

FIX

* Fixed score generation error due to GridStyle not being marked as Serializable


>Notes for 2.5.8<
[release 2014.01.16]

NEW

* RFE #127: Added sub-menu to text editor popups for orc editing for "Blue 
  Opcodes" that has entries for "blueMixerOut", "blueMixerOut (SubChannel)", and
  "blueMixerIn"

* RFE #88: BlueSynthBuilder: added new grid settings to set grid width, height,
  style (None, Dot, Line), and snap enabled. For projects before 2.5.8, older
  behavior is preserved and will default to style None and snap disabled.

* Examples: 
 
  * soundsObjects/external_ngen1a.blue, soundsObjects/external_ngen1b.blue: 
	  Example of using nGen from Blue (contributed by Menno Knevel)

  * Updated AthenaCL examples in soundObjects folder 
    (contributed by Menno Knevel)

UPDATED

* BlueSynthBuilder: small optimization: if last object that was being edited is 
  the same as the one being requested to edit, don't bother clearing the 
  interface

* BlueSynthBuilder: Added use of Backspace to delete items in addition the 
  previous delete key option

FIX

* Bug #92: Fixed setting of note pitch value to before setting of start time 
  when updating note values on mouse release

* BlueSynthBuilder: On Mac OSX, made paste shortcut use cmd-click instead of 
  ctrl-click, as ctrl-click is used by the OS as an alias for right-clicking

DOCUMENTATION

* BlueSynthBuilder: Added information about Grid Settings, always-on instrument
  code, updated images

* JMask: updated screenshots, added information about editing field names

* Added some basic information about the Code Editor to new "Code Editor" 
  section under "Tools"


>Notes for 2.5.7<
[release 2014.01.09]

UPDATED

* RFE #150: Jmask: Updated UI, moved bar from left hand side to top top for 
  parameters, added ability to set the name for the parameter by double clicking 
  the bar, added default values for p1, p2, and p3 as "Instrument ID", "Start", 
  and "Duration"

* Updated opcode definitions with latest from Csound Manual (includes things
  like pvstanal, array opcode section, etc.)

FIX

* Bug #89: Commandline Runner when rendering to disk was adding "-L stdin", 
  causing the Blue render to hang on Windows; now removed for all platforms as
  input is unnecessary when rendering to disk 

* Bug #91: Modified Locale default for formatting of numbers to use English 
  formatting (i.e. always use decimal instead of comma).  This affects things 
  like Spinner components, and the change should make number formatting uniform
  across Blue, matching Csound's number format


>Notes for 2.5.6<
[release 2013.12.18]

FIX

* Bug #90: code for Freezing SoundObjects did not properly create commandline
  arguments to run

 
>Notes for 2.5.5<
[release 2013.12.05]

FIX

* Bug #88: fixed Csound Crash when rendering to disk with Csound 6 API

[release 2013.11.28]

UPDATED

* Updated to Netbeans RCP 7.4

FIX

* issue with BlueLive toolbar not showing if hidden when Blue closed in previous
  run 

* Show error message balloon if unable to run Commandline Runner for better 
  information for the user


>Notes for 2.5.3<
[release 2013.09.21]

NEW

* Under Project menu, added option to "Generate Realtime CSD to Screen" that 
  shows what the CSD contains for realtime rendering; user can modify shortcuts
  under program options to add a keyboard shortcut  

FIX

* Pasting PolyObjects that contain Instance SoundObjects where the source object
  was removed from the SoundObject Library would cause orphan Instance objects
  to be pasted in; redid paste logic so that SoundObjects pointed to from 
  pasted Instances, including those within PolyObjects, are re-added to the 
  SoundObject Library 


>Notes for 2.5.2<
[release 2013.08.22]

FIXES

* Fixed issue when opening HTML documents that they were using an internal web
browser instead of the default system browser
 

>Notes for 2.5.1<
[release 2013.08.19]

FIXES

* Updated Audio I/O and Midi I/O Device detection in Realtime Render Settings
Panel to work with both Csound 5 and Csound 6


>Notes for 2.5.0<
[released 2013.08.12]

NEW

* Java 7 now required for Blue (Netbeans RCP library that Blue uses has 
  updated to it)

* Render service system reimplemented:
  
  * Added support for Csound6 API.  If Csound6 is found, user gets option for
    CS6 or Commandline.  If CS6 is not found, Blue will check if CS5 is 
    available. If it is, user will get that option, or only have option for 
    Commandline runner. Additionally, user can add -J-DDISABLE_CSOUND6=true in
    blue/etc/blue.conf to disable CS6 API usage and allow CS5 option.

  * Service selection is now done in Program Options under Realtime and Disk
    Render settings.  

  * The "Use API" button has been removed from the application menu and General
    Settings. 

  * Bug #82 (issue with auditioning causing crashes) should now be fixed

  * Manual entries updated for Installation and Program Options
 
* Added Steven Yi's "TimeSphere" to the examples/pieces/stevenYi folder

FIX

* SoundObject Library: When removing a library item, dialog now asks users to 
  confirm action.  If confirmed, all Instances of the SoundObject will be 
  removed from the Score and SoundObjectLibrary.

* On Mac, fixed default csound command for Utility and DiskRender settings to be
  "/usr/local/bin/csound" instead of "csound"

* UDO Import Dialog for importing from UDO Repository on Csounds.com was 
  throwing a NullPointerException when opened from a Dialog (i.e. Effects
  Library Dialog)

* Bug #84 - Fixed Zak LineObject to allow using 0 for channel

 
>Notes for 2.4.3<
[released 2013.04.05]

FIX

* Ignore orphan Instance objects that are found in the SoundObjectLibrary when
  loading projects; Blue should have prevented this situation from occurring in
  the first place, but this fix is here in case older Blue versions saved 
  projects incorrectly


>Notes for 2.4.2<
[released 2013.03.22]

FIX

* Clojure Piano Phase Example: Switched to using note format of %g instead of 
  %f, as %f will use Locale-specific float formatting (i.e. in French, 1.00 
  would be 1,00), while %g uses "computerized scientific notation or decimal 
  format, depending on the precision and the value after rounding" (from 
  documentation for java.util.Formatter)

* Default background color for output window was white instead of black

* Program Settings were not saving/loading correctly and could overwrite each
  other (i.e. sr, ksmps, etc. could get overwritten between disk and realtime
  settings)


>Notes for 2.4.1<
[released 2013.03.20]

NEW

* Added external_AthenaCL4.blue example to blue/examples/soundObjects folder; 
  contributed by Menno Knevel

* Added Dave Seidel's piece "Triune" to blue/examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder

* ClojureObject: can now load clj scripts from $HOME/.blue/script/clojure and 
  $PROJECT_DIR/script/clojure

UPDATED

* Updated Clojure library to 1.5.1

FIX

* RFE #139: Cleanup dummyXXX.csd and temp.wav that was generated by Blue after
  startup (CsoundAPIWarmupTask)

* BUG #77: Modified JACK Input/Output detection in Program Options for Realtime
  Render settings; better settings when using Csound to detect, also added a 
  fallback mechanism to use jack_lsp to list ports and parse from there


>Notes for 2.4.0<
[released 2013.02.05]

NEW

* ClojureObject - SoundObject that uses Clojure (http://www.clojure.org) code
  for generating notes
     
  * Clojure 1.4.0 is embedded with blue so that user does not have to install 
    Clojure themselves, as well as guarantees code to run on every platform

  * Editor has Syntax Highlighting and Parentheses/brace matching

  * Script menu option added to Reinitialize Clojure engine

  * clojureSoundObject.blue added to blue/examples/soundObject

  * clojure-piano-phase.blue added to blue/examples/general; this is a 
    translation of reich.cm from Common Music 2.10.0 by Heinrich Taube that 
    demonstrates phase technique

* RFE #137 - added temp file check when opening projects that searches for 
  leftover tempCsd*.csd files from previous blue sessions (usually only happens
  if blue/csound has crashed).  Offers to delete the temp files after opening,
  also checks if another project in the same folder is currently open and skips
  temp file check

* Added three examples of using AthenaCL with Blue to blue/examples/soundObjects
  folder (external_AthenaCL1.blue, etc.); contributed by Menno Knevel

NEW/FIX

* Bug #80/81: Optimized ScoreNavigatorView: introduced new paintNavigatorView
  to LayerGroupPanels so that they could paint a simplified view for the 
  Score Navigator; fixes broken painting and improves issues with time pointer
  rendering triggering frequent paints in the navigator view

FIX

* code completion for BSB Widgets would replace all code after cursor location 
  or up until ")" if found, fixed to behave as Csound ORC completion does


>Notes for 2.3.3<
[released 2012.12.19]

UPDATED

* Code Completion: for documentation window, implemented link handling and open 
  documentation in browser button

* Updated code generation when using API: use chnexport instead of chnget as it
  is more efficient

* Made all scrollpanes respond to horizontal scrolling on trackpads (includes
  documentation popup window in code completion)

FIX

* Bug #74 - fixed issues with layer edit panels losing ability to function

* Bug #75 - restored ctrl-; and ctrl-shift-; shortcuts for Csound Score text 
  editors


>Notes for 2.3.2<
[released 2012.12.16]

FIX

* Editors would lose ability to use code completion after leaving and coming 
  back to Editor

* Code completion items did not parser opcodes.xml correctly, resulting in
  incomplete signature completions and missing entries

* modified code in Brian Wong's "Falltan" and "Tritium Tea", as well as Dave
  Seidel's "Palimpsest" to work with Csound new parser


>Notes for 2.3.1<

NEW/UPDATED

* Replaced existing code editor with one based on Netbeans Editor Library

  * Editor provides much nicer code completion and opcode documentation shows
  in the application (Csound Manual now included with blue)

    settings (i.e. tab size, spaces to insert for soft tabs), settings available 
    in ProgramOptions

  * Text can be zoomed in using alt+mouse scrolling

  * Csound Orc Code
     
    * All Code Completion is now done through ctrl-space (cmd-space on Mac); 
    this includes opcode completion, variable name matches, and BSB Widget names

    * Code Editors that have been replaced: GenericScore, BlueSynthBuilder, 
    Effects Editor, User-Defined Opcode Editor, Global Orchestra (incl. tabs 
    within instrument editors)

  * Csound Score Code
    
    * Code Editors that have been replaced: Global Score (incl. tabs within 
    instrument editors), GenericScore

  * Python Code

    * Code Editors that have been replaced: PythonObject, Python Instrument

  * Javascript Code

    * Code Editors that have been replaced: RhinoObject, Rhino Instrument

UPDATED

* Now packaging Csound Manual together with blue, for use with new editor's 
  code completion to show opcode information while coding

* Removed Csound Manual Documentation Root option in Program Options

* Removed old text color settings panel

* Removed Help button on main toolbar as it was redundant to Csound Manual 
  options in Help Menu

FIX

* Render time pointer was being rendered when switching projects for the 
  projects that were not the currently rendering project

* When rendering with API, automation values were always starting from time 0;
  adjusted current time calculation

* Bug 3591867 - Fixed issue with JMask Segment modifying its points after each
  render

* Fixed intermittent issue with layer operations on Score; moved execution of 
  Process on Load SoundObjects to separate thread when loading to prevent 
  long-running operation on Swing dispatch thread


>Notes for 2.3.0<
[released 2012.11.14]

NEW

* Modular Timeline: 
  
  * Layer Groups are now modular (plug-ins)

  * (Please read manual entry for Score, sub-section Layer Groups for more 
  information)

  * patternsLayerGroupExample.blue added to examples/general

* Added "Search Csound Manual" option in Help menu to allow searching online
  Csound Manual using search terms (i.e. "guard point"); uses Google search

* New Python Console window, allows console-interaction with current python code
  for inspection and experimentation

* Added Steven Yi's "The Living Ocean" to the examples/pieces/stevenYi folder

* Python: for Orchestra Library, added possibility to pass in either noteList or
  function that will generate a noteList(partials work too) to PerformerGroup's
  perform method.  If a noteList is passed in, that same list will get 
  distributed to each Performer to perform. If a function or partial is passed
  in, it will be called to generate a new noteList for each Performer to 
  perform.  Note: the function or partial should be a no-arg method, so use of
  partials (from functools) is useful here to fix args before passing in a 
  function.

* Python: PMask, added FuncGen and CombiGen Generators (in pmask/generator.py),
  useful for mixing in functional-style work with Generators.  From 
  py doc for the classes:

  * FuncGen: Generator that acceptors one generator and one single-arg function. 
    Evaluation will call the passed-in generator, then apply the function to the 
    generator. Useful with lambdas and partials for the passed in function.
  
  * CombiGen: Generator that acceptors two generators and one two-arg function. 
    Evaluation will call valueAt on the two generators, then pass the results to 
    the two-arg function for further processing. Useful with lambdas and 
    partials for the passed in function.

* VirtualKeyboard: added keyboard shortcuts when keyboard is in focus:

    * up/down: increment or decrement octave
    * shift-up/shift-down: increment or decrement channel
  
* Debian/Ubuntu: blue starter script in blue/bin is now pre-setup to use the API 
  when Csound is installed through apt-get

UPDATED

* Updated to Jython 2.5.3

* Modified UserDefinedOpcode List tables:
  
  * allow selection of multiple UDO's for copying and pasting

  * can now copy UDO Categories from the UDO Library manager and paste into list
  tables; all UDO's from that category and subcategory will be pasted into the 
  target table (useful for keeping a group of UDO's together to paste into new
  instruments)

* can now drag and drop UDO Category from the UDO Library to a UDO Table

* SoundObjectProperties Window: 
  
  * When editing SoundObject name, now updates as you type

  * When SoundObjectProperties windows becomes focused (selecting the window, 
  pressing F3, using window menu), name textfield requests focus; makes it 
  easier to edit SoundObjectName or tab down to other fields

* Manual: 

  * closed the online Wiki and migrated back to using Docbook

  * release once again includes HTML and PDF versions of the manual 
  (located in blue/manual folder or blue.app/manual)

  * Blue Manual link from Help menu points to HTML version of manual

FIX

* Auditioning SoundObjects would cause a crash of program due to unnecessary 
  deleting of Csound Object

* Command-line compiling option for compiling .blue to CSD files was always 
  reporting exit code 1 and error, even when compile was done correctly

* Using "Paste" and "Paste as PolyObject" were incorrectly pasting soundObjects
  using the x-coordinate as the time value, i.e. instead of pasting at time 4 
  it might paste at time 80 if it was 20 pixels per second

* CommandlineRunner - modified how commandline runner stops Csound to prevent
  hanging csound processes on Linux

* UDO - When dragging from the library to a UDO list table, was allowing move
  option, when it should only allow copying

* when creating new UDO's, name now defaults to "newOpcode" rather than 
  "New Opcode", as the latter is not a valid UDO name

* BSB - When API is not enabled, BSBDropdown should still generate with index
  value instead of dropdown item's value if automation is set to enabled

* when opening projects that had temp files, do not add the temp file to the 
  recent projects list

* TrackerObject

  * made shortcut for ctrl-space and ctrl-shift-space also use control instead 
  of command key on OSX to avoid issue with spotlight shortcut

  * fixed track editor sizing

  * fixed issue with OFF notes being editable, causing issues with not allowing
  moving past those notes with arrow keys. OFF notes can now only be cleared
  with ctrl-shift-space or a new note entered by using keyboard shortcut keys

  * changed backspace shortcut to shift-backspace, due to interfering when 
  editing values

INTERNAL

* replaced passing of SoundObjectLibrary when saving/loading, now uses 
  Map<String, Object> on load and Map<Object,String> on save, where object is
  a SoundObject and String is a uniqueId; make saving/loading generic and 
  removes dependency on SoundObjectLibrary


>Notes for 2.2.2<
[released 2012.04.03]

NEW

* BSBFileSelector: 

  * Accepts dragging and dropping a file from filesystem onto the
    textfield porting of the FileSelector

  * Added property "stringChannelEnabled" that replaces the object name with a
    gS_blue_strX variable instead of static text replacement; when enabled,
    blue generates the string variable as well as uses a string channel to allow
    live modification of the string when the API is enabled; useful for things 
    like switching what sample to use in sample player instrument; by default,
    the property is enabled, but legacy projects will correctly read in as 
    disabled

* blueLive: 

  * added ctrl-c/ctrl-v (cmd-c/cmd-v on OSX) for copying/pasting SoundObjects in
    the SoundObject bins

  * added LiveObject Sets List: 
        * save sets of enabled LiveObjects by using + button
        * Rename Set by using popup menu
        * Use - button to remove a set
        * Use ^/V buttons to push up and push down
        * Rollover a set to see what items are Enabled for that set (highlights
          in LiveObject table)

UPDATED

* blueLive: leave repeat on even if blueLive turns off or recompiles; useful if
  recompiling often

FIX

* Snap on PianoRoll did not work correctly note resizing

* Recoded mouse handling on ScoreTimeline to consistently use time values 
  internally, fixes issues when snap enabled

* Nudging SoundObjects with arrow keys did not nudge enclosed automations


>Notes for 2.2.1<
[released 2012.03.07]

UPDATED

* blueLive:
  
  * when a SoundObject is selected and also enabled, made color render as 
    brighter orange color to differentiate from non-selected enabled objects

  * fixed saving/loading of repeat and tempo settings

  * update name of SoundObject in bins when updated from SoundObject Properties
    Window

* SoundObject Property Window: setting repeat point with enter key shows value
  reformatted as float

* Added blueIcon.png to bin folder in zip release, for use on Linux

FIX

* Auditioning of SoundObjects was not working due to serialization bug

* Score: Fixed Snap (rendering in timeline, time bar, dragging soundObjects, 
  resizing soundObjects)

* PianoRoll: Fixed Snap (rendering in timeline, time bar, dragging of notes,
  resizing of notes)


>Notes for 2.2.0<
[released 2012.03.03]

UPDATED

* Modified UDO Editor to have In Types, Out Types, and Test button on single 
  line 

* blueLive: 

  * moved from List of SoundObjects to table with bins (columns and rows added
    from popup menu, accesible by right-click)

  * double-clicking SoundObject toggles enabled state (orange color)

  * trigger button sends score events from enabled SoundObjects

  * tempo will be applied before score events sent to Csound, for example, using
    tempo 120, score "i1 0 2" will be sent as "i1 0 1" 

  * repeat button will repeat trigger every n-number of beats, as specified by
    user

  * careful attention should be made while editing SoundObjects in case a repeat
    trigger fires and the score is not quite valid; can cause unpredictable and
    very loud results due to typos!

  * Ctrl-T (on Mac, Cmd-T): Triggers currently selected SoundObject (whether 
    enabled or not)
  
  * Ctrl-Shift-T(on Mac, Cmd-Shift-T): Triggers currently enabled SoundObjects,
    same as using the trigger button

* csLADSPA removed from Project Properties

FIX

* Upgrade code for 2.1.10 caused incorrect loading of projects that have data 
  in Global Orchestra (newlines were getting removed)

* Bug 3495199 - Added scrollpanes to panels within Project Properties to 
  facilitate resizing


>Notes for 2.1.10<
[released 2012.02.27]

NEW

* New 0dbfs field in project properties for Disk and Realtime render settings;
  Checkbox enables if 0dbfs will be used. If older projects are found that have
  0dbfs set in their Global Orchestra, it will be parsed and the field set in 
  the project, and the old line removed from Global Orchestra.  Program settings
  added to set defaults for projects (if using 0dbfs and what default value). 

* Added Brian Wong's "Syzygyr" piece to the examples/pieces/brianWong folder

* Added Dave Seidel's "Drift Study III" and "Ansible Cathedral" pieces to the 
  examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder

* Added Csound API Warmup Task to prevent first time load pause when rendering

* Added Full Screen support on Mac OSX Lion 

* Added "Disable Displays" option to Realtime and Disk render program options,
  defaults to true; adds "-d" to commandline used when rendering project

* Reinstated printing of commandline used when rendering, now outputs to Output
  Window of render

Updated

* Worked on updating look and feel

* RFE 3473214: Made Text fields that show values in BSB HSlider and VSlider
  clickable and editable, as found previous in BSBKnob.  Applies to HSliderBank
  and VSliderBank as well.

INTERNAL

* modified to use CsoundMYFLTArray instead of Csound.SetChannel() to optimize
  setting channel values (avoid cost of ptr lookup by name on each change)

* removed use of Rhino Javascript interpreter and instead use Java 6's scripting
  engine and built-in Javascript interpreter (removes a dependency and saves 
  size)


>Notes for 2.1.9<
[released 2011.11.28]

FIX

* Render Time Pointer code changes were not properly account for tempo and 
  t-statements


>Notes for 2.1.8<
[released 2011.11.19]

UPDATED

* Render Time Pointer Animation code redesigned for smoother playback, made 
  default Playback Setting option for Frames Per Second default to 24 fps

* OSX - Removed use of -D32 flag when running blue, now will default to whatever
  version of Java the user has set by default (64-bit, 32-bit) 

* BSB - Made Checkboxes Automatable [RFE 3419780]


FIX

* OSX - Opening sub-popup menus would cause an exception to be thrown, caused by
  changes in 2.1.7 to get the System Menu Bar working in blue 


>Notes for 2.1.7<
[released 2011.11.05]

NEW

* Added Help menu link for "blue/Csound IRC Chat" that will open up the Freenode
  webchat webpage to chat in #bluecsound and #csound channels for help

* Added ability to double click split pane dividers within windows to minimize
  the divider to the far left or right (or up/down), depending on which side it
  is closest to; i.e. double-click to minimize the project instrument list and
  instrument library to maximize the space for the Instrument Editor interface

* OSX: Made Look and Feel work with System Menu Bar

* Added Dave Seidel's "Cloud Study" pieces to the examples/pieces/daveSeidel 
  folder

UPDATED

* Updated opcodes.xml to use latest from 5.14 manual

FIX

* Extra render time from mixer was being added twice to the total duration when
  creating note for Mixer instrument

* Instantiating BSB instruments that previously did not have Always-On Text 
  could cause exceptions when rendering

* BSB Interface editor would nudge selected objects after edit enabled turned 
  off (Bug #3424474)

* BlueLive: Recompile button would get a hung dialog if the code that changed 
  caused a compilation error by Csound


>Notes for 2.1.6<
[released 2011.09.29]

NEW

* Added ctrl-shift-w (cmd-shift-w) shortcut to close the current project

* Added .csoundrc Editor to the tools menu, will open file pointed to by 
  CSOUNDRC environment variable, or if not defined will use $HOME/.csoundrc

FIXES

* If no parameters are used, no longer generate a parameter instrument; fixes
  scenario when user is using just global orc/sco to not generate an instr with
  an overlapping instr number

* blueLive MIDI generated notes using bare note number instead of padded number,
  i.e. "i1.1" instead of "i1.001".  Not padding caused a possible clash if 
  fractional value collided, i.e. "i1.1", "i1.10", and "i1.100" would clash with
  each other


>Notes for 2.1.5<
[released 2011.09.22]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - add setting of font size in Text Settings section of program 
            options, renamed "Text Colors" to "Text Settings" in options
            RFE 3371772

    [new] - added Brian Wong's "Falltan" to examples/pieces/brianWong

    [new] - double-clicking SoundObject on timeline (except polyObject) now 
            opens and focuses SoundObject editor (useful if editor is docked and
            set to sliding to pop open the editor)

    [new] - implemented blueLive Recompile button   

    [updated] - modified scroll wheel/trackpad handling on score timeline to 
            work better with trackpads; horizontal/vertial trackpad motion will 
            do scrolling, holding down alt- will increase/decrease horizontal
            zoom, holding down ctrl- (or cmd- on Mac) will increase/decrease
            vertical zoom

    [updated] - Made PortAudio blocking interface (pa_bl) the default audio 
            driver on OSX as "PortAudio" and "pa_cb" uses the callback interface
            which has caused crashes

    [updated] - Changed blue Manual link to point to blue wiki

    [fix] - restored use of ctrl-z/ctrl-shift-z to undo/redo operations on the
            score timeline

    [fix] - BSB - fixed rounding error when setting value in Sliders

    [fix] - stabilized blue and Csound API usage by clearing MessageCallback
            and HostData before calling Reset

    [fix] - made backspace as well as delete work for deleting notes in 
            PianoRoll


>Notes for 2.1.4<
[released 2011.07.11]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Virtual Midi Keyboard - visual piano keyboard with keyboard 
            shortcuts for input; generates MIDI note on/off's that route through
            blue's MIDI system

    [updated] - BlueSynthBuilder - moved "Manage Presets" button from top
		    level to being a menu option in the "Presets" menu

    [fix] - issue with German Keyboards where ALT key is used to access 
            characters fixed (keys using ALT were blocked)

    [fix] - made "/usr/local/bin/csound" the default for OSX for Realtime and
            Disk Render settings for new blue installations

>Notes for 2.1.3<
[released 2011.04.06]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [updated] - reorganized Project Properties editor to have Realtime and Disk
            render settings first, then have Project Information

    [fix] - BlueSynthBuilder - code for instrument would not correctly generate
            during a session if new object was added that used an objectName
            that would change the sorting order of widgets (project would
            generate correctly if reopened in a new session)

    [fix] - BlueSynthBuilder - allow generation of code to succeed for dropdown
            lists when no items are entered (will simply not replace any values
            in the generated code)

>Notes for 2.1.2<
[released 2011.04.03]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [updated/fix] - On Mac, replaced ctrl- based shortcuts with command- based
            shortcuts for most components

    [fix] - blueMixerIn (used by always-on instrument code) did not properly
            generate when more than one input arg was used

    [fix] - fixed ftable converter tool to work when there is a space between
            the 'f' and the table num

blue

    [new] - Added Dave Seidel's "Herald of Water, Herald of Air" and "Gyre" to 
            the examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder

    [new] - Added Brian Wong's "Pythongorean Wanderers" and "FMBot-00" to 
            examples/pieces/brianWong

    [new] - Added ability for BlueSynthBuilder instruments to have Always-On
            instrument code

    [new] - OSX - made blue.conf default to have -J-d32 in the default_args to
            force using 32-bit mode Java on OSX; this enables working with
            Csound API when using the Csound 5.13 OSX Installer

    [updated] - modified shortcuts for opcode completion and BSB Object name
            completion to always use ctrl- shortcut, even on OSX (due to
            cmd-space being used as system shortcut for Spotlight)

    [updated] - Jython library for Python objects updated to version 2.5.2

    [fix] - Audition SoundObjects caused a null pointer due to MIDI class
            introduced in 2.1.0

    [fix] - shutdown blueLive on application exit to prevent Csound crash if
            instance is running

    [fix] - Updated pmask to work with newer jython/python by replacing whrandom
            with random.WeichmannHill()
  
    [fix] - Fixed issue with Realtime and Disk render settings not saving 
            correctly

    [fix] - fixed bug where when API was enabled, rendering to disk would not 
            work if "csound" was not in the system path; instead, always use
            command given in disk render settings panel

    [fix] - made Send always generate if enabled (bug was that it would get 
            optimized out if level set to 0, even if automated)

    [fix] - MIDI Driver settings were not being loaded correctly


>Notes for 2.1.0<
[released 2010.06.09]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Added Steven Yi's "Reminiscences" and Brian Wong's "Tritium Tea" to
            examples/pieces folder

    [updated] - moved blueLive buttons for starting/stopping and all notes off
            to and application toolbar

    [updated] - moved blueLive MIDI input to Input Settings Top Component

    [updated] - BSBDropdown is now automatable; when set to automatable, will
            use the index of the selected item rather than the value set for
            that item, and will also generate a a k-rate signal

    [updated] - Scale selectin panels now have a popup menu (triggered by right
            mouse button) that has a "Reset (12TET)" option to reset the scale
            to the default 12TET tuning

    [updated] - When using "Save as" or doing a save when closing a file, if the 
            save is designated over an existing file, blue will ask for 
            confirmation from the user

    [updated] - BSB Knob - when editing value in textfield, now starts off with
            text selected for easier editing (RFE 3006108)

    [updated] - Added text color setting in options for pfields (RFE 2970509)

    [fix] - Closing project did not ask user to save file

    [fix] - blueLive: when using API, no longer tries to update render time

    [fix] - blue Application Log was using black on black text, changed to use
            white text

    [fix] - default creation of codeRepository was broken, resulting in opcode
            popup not properly creating itself if existing codeRepository not
            found

    [fix] - opening the blue manual did not work when blue was installed into a
            directory where there were spaces in the path name (Bug 2982079)

    [fix] - opening the blue manual did not work for the OSX release

    [fix] - opening the csound manual and opcode help did not prepend "file://"
            if opening from the local file system, also would have errors if
            spaces were in the path (Bug 2981573)

    [fix] - score expression parser was calculating values using integers
            instead of floats i.e. [1/3] was returning 0 instead of 0.33333
            (Bug 3006243)

blue

    [new] - Added "Save Copy" button to Frozen SoundObject's editor to allow
            saving a copy of the the frozen soundfile (RFE 2970189)

    [new] - Readded "Script" menu with option to reinitialize Jython interpreter
            to address issue in Bug 2789770

    [new] - Made TrackerObject work with fractional instruments (RFE 2826952)

    [new] - Added links to blue manual and csound manual from help menu
            (RFE 2936569)

    [fix] - Fixed issue with BSB Dropdown Lists when item list changes (items
            added/removed) and preset is selected.  Preset value is now stored
            by uniqueId of dropdown item to prevent issues with storing by
            item index.  Older presets that stored by index still work. New
            presets saved will save by uniqueId.  One can update an older preset
            to use the new uniqueId system by selecting the preset and
            immediately choosing update for the preset. (Bug 2017191)

    [fix] - Python NoteProcessor caused exception when showing it's code editor


>Notes for 2.0.8<

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Added Backspace key as alternate way to delete soundObjects to
            Delete key

    [fix] - OSX: Fixed paste and duplicate actions with mouse to use Command Key
            (Command-Click to paste, Command-Click-Drag to duplicate
            soundObjects) and also fixed to use command key in PianoRoll

    [fix] - Project defaults were not being set correctly (Author, Realtime and
            Disk render settings)

    [fix] - Fixed issues with Adding/Editing Effects and Sends on the Mixer when
            the Mixer is undocked

    [fix] - Fixed audio device parsing for Coreaudio

    [fix] - modified library saving code to write to a temporary file first
            before renaming to the final to prevent clearing the library if
            there is a problem during the save (Bug 2961116)

blue

    [new] - Python: for Orchestra Library, added new bluePch related functions
            in ScoreUtilities.py:

            getBluePchBaseTen(pch, numScaleDegrees)
            getBluePch(baseTen, numScaleDegrees)
            bluePchAdd(pch, addValue, numScaleDegrees)
            bluePchDiff(pch1, pch2)
            makeBluePchSet(startPch, intervalList, numScaleDegrees)

            please see source python files for more information

    [updated] - blueLive: updated to no longer use its own SoundObjectEditPanel
            but instead to reuse the common SoundObjectEdit Window.  Now able
            to use NoteProcessors with soundObjects in blueLive

    [updated] - Made SoundObject Editor Window no longer use green border but
            instead modify window title when editing SoundObjects from library
            or blueLive

    [updated] - Python: Orchestra Tuning class modified to reuse blue's internal
            Scale class

    [updated] - PianoRoll: modified mouse handling so that if clicking a note
            for resizing, it will immediately start drag mode (previously
            required first click to select, then second click to resize)

    [fix] - blueLive: right-click popup menu was not working for cut/copy/paste
            to/from Score timeline

    [fix] - modified APIRunner code to prevent crash when blueLive was running
            and Score render was initiated when using Csound API

    [fix] - modified Audition runner code to prevent crash when auditioning
            soundObjects and an already running audition is going

    [fix] - adding a SoundObject to the SoundObject library created and Instance
            object but did not actually add the item to the library

    [fix] - adding and Instrument to the project orchestra did not create
            associated Mixer Channels correctly if Mixer window was not
            previously opened during session


>Notes for 2.0.4<

blue

    [new] - implemented score carry as Csound does, such that if the previous
            note has the same base instr number, pfields not specified at end
            of note will carry over, i.e.

            i1 0 2 3 4 5
            i1.1 0 .
            i1 0 .

            will become:

            i1 0 2 3 4 5
            i1.1 0 2 3 4 5
            i1 0 2 3 4 5

    [new] - when pasting BSB objects with existing names, will now use the
            existing name plus an incremented number, i.e. pasting an object
            with name "freq" will be named "freq1", and another copy would be
            "freq2" (RFE 2847420)

    [new/fix] - Updated blue's plugin mechanism to address issue with blueLive
            where an exception was thrown when trying to add objects

    [fix] - JMask: Added support for negative p3 (tied notes)

blue

    [updated] - Updated opcodes.xml definitions with latest from Csound Manual 

    [fix] - Mixer: If mixer window was undocked into its own dialog when first
            time choosing "Edit Effect" it would cause an Exception to occur

    [fix] - Mixer: Extra Time Field was not correctly anchored


>Notes for 2.0.2<

blue

    [new] - Presets: Added ability to see most recent preset selected and update
            it with the values in the UI

    [fix] - Mixer: master chanel strip was not being set as master in code and
            was thus showing an output dropdown (was not being used by blue and
            was just a cosmetic issue)

    [fix] - BlueSynthBuilder: Projects using SubChannelDropdowns did not
            correctly create the instrument's UI due to a bug in the view
            factory code for creating views

    [fix] - Import MIDI File did not work as it did not set the imported
            PolyObject as root correctly, causing all score work from there to
            generate with a 2 second duration (bug existed prior to blue 2.0)

            Documentation Root

    [updated] - Options/blue/General: made work directory an editable text field

    [fix] - Options/blue/Utility: button for selecting Csound Executable did not
            work

    [fix] - Options/blue/Disk Render: the file browser button for the Csound
            Executable field did not work

            advantage of new Window Manager and many libraries

    [new] - Added PulseAudio as driver option for Realtime Render settings on
            Linux

    [new] - Added pieces by Brian Wong to examples\pieces\brianWong folder

>Notes for 0.125.0<
[released 2008.12.01]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Added "Process On Load" to PythonObject; allows running of that
            PythonObject instance's script when a project is loaded or switched
            to; for usage where user has code at the beginning of a project,
            allows for that code to load on start so one can just start
            rendering from later in the project with code that depends on those
            earlier PythonObjects

    [new] - Added ability to scale a SoundObject by moving its start time
            (dragging from left side)

    [new] - Added scaling of automation data when scaling a single soundObject
            in Score Mode

    [new] - Added moving of automation data when moving soundObjects in Score
            Mode

    [new] - added 20 pixel buffer when moving start time pointer to more easily
            see when dragging as well as when jumping from marker to marker

    [new] - Added check of location of dialogs when opening modal dialogs (i.e.
            soundObject properties, mixer, etc.) and adjust to place on screen

    [new] - Added "Reset Time Log" option to Help menu to reset start time for
            time log

    [new] - Add Marker action: when not rendering project, marker action now
            stays enabled and will add marker at where the Render Start time
            is current set

    [new] - Added "Use Csound API" option on Project menu to allow easier
            toggling between enabling/disabling use of the Csound API

    [new] - blueLive: Added "All Notes Off" button which will turn off all notes
            for instruments found in the project Orchestra (will not turn off
            mixer or any other specially generated instruments)

    [updated] - added more buffer size when scrolling score time canvas so block
            increment is not as big and drastic when using touchpad for
            scrolling

    [fix] - Add Marker action: when rendering project, marker was being added
            relative to time 0 instead of render start time;

blue

    [new] - Added piece "Unstill Light" by Dave Seidel to 
            examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder

    [update] - Added caching of values when rendering live using API so as to 
            only set the value in Csound if the value changed in the project 
            (performance optimization)

    [update] - BSB Widgets now always emit k-rate signals if they are set as 
            automatable ("Automation Allowed") whether using API or not; 
            previously widgets would try to optimize by generating as constant
            when automatable but not automated, but this caused an issue with
            Csound coding; an object that is set to be automatable makes sense
            that code that depends on it should assume it could be k-rate

            NOTE: This is a break in backwards compatibility! The known 
            workaround is to set the widget as not automatable or to update
            Csound code to use a k-rate signal

    [fix] - commandline use of blue to convert .blue project to CSD was broken

    [fix] - "Generate CSD to File" was broken

    [fix] - changed settings on ScoreTimeCanvas so that ghost drawing of render
            time pointer would not occur while rendering (multiple orange lines)

documentation

    [update] - Updated information to more clearly explain value will be gk-rate
            signal when a BSB widget is set to allow automation, even if it is
            not automated at the time

    [new] - added section on breaks in backwards compatibility (Appendix B)


>Notes for 0.124.2<
[released 2008.09.29]

blue

    [fix] - Csound API detection was causing blue to crash at start and become
            unsuable if csnd.jar was not found


>Notes for 0.124.1<
[released 2008.09.28]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [update] - by default, have "Save Peak Information in Header" option on 
            Disk Render Settings default to true; will only affect new 
            installations of blue where no previous user settings found in 
            $HOME/.blue directory

    [fix] - Fixed instability issues on Linux when using Csound API by 
            initializing Csound library to not install signal handlers

    [fix] - When loading older projects before BSB Widgets had automatable 
            option, now default to false only if widget was not already 
            automated (fixes problems with opening legacy projects and running
            project with API enabled)

    [fix] - open, ran, and fixed blue/examples projects to run with API

    [fix] - When using API, always use "csound" for csound executable command
            when building command line for Csound API; fixes problem when 
            executable had a full path with space in it, i.e. 
            "C:\Program Files\Csound\bin\csound.exe" as API mode does not really
            use that first argument, but having space would cause the value to
            be split into two args and would then cause render to fail; allows
            keeping above value with space when rendering without API and 
            switching to API then will not cause a problem

documentation

    [update] - Added information to csoundAPI section of Installing Csound about
            java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError and how to update starter scripts 
            with -Djava.library.path=xxx

    [update] - Added information to BlueSynthBuilder and Parameter Automation
            documentation to clarify the requirement that when using the Csound 
            API, the area in the Csound code where the widget value is replaced
            must accept a k-rate signal for widgets which are set to automatable

    [update] - Added note that blueLive works on Windows when using the Csound
            API


>Notes for 0.124.0<

blue

    [new] - implemented working with Csound API (double-precision build), 
            enabling modifying of automations and widget values in real time 
            during render; to enable, please view new documentation added on 
            setting up blue with the API

    [new] - Added piece "Second Sleep" by Dave Seidel to 
            examples/pieces/daveSeidel folder

    [updated] - made blueX7 envelope editor draw with black background and gray 
            border to make it easier to see; will continue to update in future
            release

    [fix] - When loading older projects before BSB Widgets had automatable

    [fix] - JMask

            -Duration was not being set for Mask, Accumulator, and Quantizer; if
            a table was used for any values in those modifiers, the duration of
            those tables were being calculated as if they were 1 beat long, so
            any values generated after 1 beat would pretty much use the value 
            set at the end of the table; duration is now set correctly

            -Dropdowns in UI's did not initialize to the value that the 
            edited object currently held when first populating interface


>Notes for 0.123.0<
[released 2008.06.06]

    [new] - JMask - new SoundObject based on Andre Bartetzki's CMask; currently
            supports same exact features as are available in CMask though using
            a graphical user interface to create and configure parameters, 
            masks, quantizers, accumultators, etc.

    [new/updated] - implemented completed single-line and multi-line modes: able
            to select time area, then drag selection area to move automation 
            points for currently edited line in single-line mode, all lines 
            and soundObjects under selection area in multi-line mode; more
            information in documentation

    [update] - when rendering, now checks if instruments are muted and if so,
            optimize CSD generation and mixer to not generate code for 
            those channels associated with muted instruments
    
    [fix] - processing of command blocks (i.e. ;[pre]{) trimmed the empty spaces 
            around lines of text; now leaves formatting in tact
    
    [fix] - Problem with Tempo caused "Audition SoundObjects" to break 

    [fix] - reenabled cut/copy/paste on NoteProcessorChain editors, fixed to 
            make buffered noteProcessor be global and can copy/paste in all
            noteProcessor editors (i.e. SoundObject, SoundLayer, polyObject),
            fixed to make NoteProcessorChain table be max height always of
            scrollPane so that right mouse button can always open up popup

documentation

    [new] - added initial basic documentation for JMask in the Reference section 
            for SoundObjects

    [new/updated] - Updated "Parameter Automation" in the Concepts section of 
            the manual with information on the updated Single-Line and 
            Multi-Line modes

    [updated] - Reviewed all reference documentation for NoteProcessors, adding
            better examples showing before and after processing

    [new] - Tempo Editor - allows graphical editing of tempo on timeline for 
            root polyObject; clicking "Use Tempo" checkbox will enable use of
            tempo line and clicking of down arrow will show the tempo for 
            editing or collapse it to reduce screen space usage; if enabled,
            will generate a Csound t-statement to control global tempo; older
            project which manually added t-statements in global orc will run
            correctly as tempo editor is not enabled by default; right-clicking
            on tempo line area when in edit mode will allow option to edit 
            point values by table or to set the min/max bpm for the tempo line
            with option to truncate or rescale line point values for new min/max

    [new] - added ability to set Code Text Area background color in Program 
            Options dialog

    [new] - Snap

            -Setting render start time and render end time now snap if snap is
            enabled; one can modify without snap if snap is enabled by clicking,
            then holding down shift, move around (holding shift when clicking
            creates a marker, so one should press shift after mouse down)

            -Setting automation points now snap x value if snap is enabled; 
            holding down shift while editing will allow free setting of x value

    [new] - added <RENDER_START_ABSOLUTE> blue variable, equal RENDER_START
            value but timewarped if t-statement used
 
    [update] - Tuning NoteProcessor: formerly only held the name of the Scala 
            file from the .blue/scl directory to use and this file would get
            parsed everytime it was used; changed to use same Scale class that
            the PianoRoll uses and now loads in content of files and saves it
            with the project, making the project more portable.  
            
            For older projects, when loading project will be auto-upgraded and
            contents of scale will get loaded in.  If scale is not found, 
            results are not predictable and project will likely fail to open.

    [fix] - Tempo Mapper 

            -Fixed timePointer location if tempo used and renderStart > 0

            -Fixed timePointer location if two tempo points had same beat time
            value (i.e. hard jump in tempo)

            -Fixed timePointer location if tempo used and two consecutive tempo 
            points had same tempo

    [fix] - fixed "Convert to BSB" option on Orchestra to copy over UDO's, also
            fixed NullPointerException bug in adding parameters after conversion 

    [fix] - BSB FileSelector was always saving and using absolute file path 
            instead of using relative path if within directory of project or 
            in a subdirectory thereof; switched to use relative when possible to
            make projects more portable 

    [fix] - Automation values may not reach end value if ksmps did not equal 1;
            added extra parameter note to ensure setting of end values

    [fix] - BSB/ObjectBuilder/Effects - Randomization of sliders using 
            resolution never achieved maximum value

blue

    [new] - Added "Always Render Entire Project" option to Project Properties 
            for disk renders; if checked, will render to disk as if the render
            end wasn't set and as if rendering from time 0 regardless of what
            values are used in render start/end which still affects realtime 
            playback

    [new] - added optional color theming: if blueTheme.properties is found in 
            the user's .blue directory, values will be used to set blue's colors
            for theme; colors normally used are:

            primary1=198,226,255
            primary2=153,153,204
            primary3=204,204,255
            secondary1=102,177,253
            secondary2=63,102,150
            secondary3=38,51,76
            black=240,240,255
            white=0,0,0

            all eight of the above properties must be defined in the 
            blueTheme.properties if the theme file is to be used; color values
            are equivalent to RGB with range 0-255 for each color

    [fix] - Mixer was not correctly setting slider positions when loading or
            switching to a project

    [new] - added "clear" functionality to the BSB file selector widget via 
            popup menu

    [new] - made channel level label an editable text field after 
            double-clicking

    [updated] - Made Orchestra manager's Instr ID column adjustable
    

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Added support for manage csLADSPA settings: csLADSPA tab and editor
            added to Project Properties; if enabled, will add <csLADSPA> block
            to generated CSD.  Support was also added to "Import from CSD" 
            feature to read in csLADSPA blocks found in CSD's.              

    [new] - SoundFont Viewer - Added right-click popup menu to file tree with 
            option to "Copy Path", copying the full path of the selected file 
            in the file tree to the system clipboard

    [new] - for InfoDialog (used to show text such as when Generating Code to 
            Screen), added a CaretPositionDisplay to bottom right that shows the 
            line number and caret position in that line

    [new] - LineObject, ZakLineObject, BSB LineObject - Added option for "Link
            First/Last" points to properties for Line, allowing to make first 
            and last line points linked so that modifications to one will apply
            to the other; useful when using line objects for ftables for 
            oscilators

    [updated] - Updated conf/opcodes.xml to latest opcodes from 5.08; also 
            checked in a copy of the quickrefBlue.py file based on quickref.py
            in the csound manual src tree, used to generate the opcodes.xml
            file; also added ant create-opcodes-file target

    [fix] - LineObjectCanvas - prevent adding points outside the canvas area as
            well as fixed off-by-one error exception when inserting new points

    [fix] - Automatic ftable numbering used by objects like the LineObject now
            take into account any ftgen statements found in the global orc

    [fix] - blueX7 p3-resetting code restored (change was in 0.116.0) as 
            original Pinkston code made DX7 emulation monophonic due to use of
            ihold opcode and current version of Csound does not seem to suffer
            from problems of resetting p3

documentation

    [new] - added information about csLADSPA settings to the section for Project 
            Properties

blue

    [new] - modified Instrument edit area to show same kind of label of "Editing
            Library Instrument" as was implemented for SoundObject editing in
            0.119.0

    [new] - added shift-F2 shortcut to BlueEditorPane so if over an opcode, will
            try to open up the example CSD from the manaul for that opcode and
            display the example

    [new] - added 01_funky.blue example to blue/examples/general folder

    [new/updated] - blueShare - when selecting an instrument or Effect to
            export, will now pre-populate description text field for import from
            instrument/effect's comments text field; user is still able to
            modify the description text field to summarize or truncate the
            information before submitting

    [new/updated] - replaced using BlueTextArea with JTextArea for Comment text
            in Instruments and UDO's; the text is no longer highlighting for
            Csound code (which didn't make sense really) as well as has line
            wrapping enabled for long lines

    [updated] - rearranged Orchestra manager editor so that the User Instrument
            Library and project orchestra is now held on the left while the
            instrument editor area now takes up the entire right hand side of
            the split pane, giving more room to the instrument editor.

    [updated] - updated /blue/examples/scripting/feldman.blue to newer version
            using new instruments (b64 SID emulation and triangle wave
            instrument), also updated comments and layout to more modern blue
            usage (for example, used Mixer system instead of hand done routing)

    [fix] - Parameters for Effects were not being cleared when copies were 
            pasted

    [fix] - When reopening projects with soundObjects or instruments that had 
            an empty name, would cause a null pointer exception  

    [fix] - When reopening projects with GenericScore soundObjects that had 
            an empty score, would cause a null pointer exception on score 
            rendering  

    [fix] - When opening files using commandline args to blue, absolute version
            of file was not used and soundObject freezing would not work

    [fix] - When working with named instruments, programmatic adding of
            instruments was problematic due to poor checking of instrument ID's

    [fix] - Opcode Completion and search for opcode manual entry or example did
            not filter out "(" parenthesis when looking for word where text
            caret was, therefore did not lookup functions correctly (i.e. ampdb)

    [fix] - Loading of pre-0.94.0 projects was broken, fixes made and plans for
            frozen upgrading tool for pre-0.94.0 in the works for later release

    [fix] - CSD import for 'Import Score and Split into SoundObjects by
            Instrument Number' method was broken

blue

    [new] - implemented partial SoundObject rendering, allowing SoundObjects to
            be able to take in relative renderStart and renderEnd and to use
            that information when generating notes; AudioFile, Frozen
            SoundObject, and both LineObject classes can now generate notes if
            renderStart happens in the middle of their duration (previously,
            a soundObject would generate a note for the entire duration, then
            notes would get translated to the renderStart time and then filtered
            if notes do not start at time 0.0 or great; this process still
            happens, but for the above SoundObjects, partial notes will now be
            generated that are adjusted to the render start and those objects
            will contribute notes that won't get filtered out and will start
            playback in the middle of their content)

            (Thanks to Michael Bechard for suggesting this!)

    [new] - When clicking an Instance soundObject, will no longer use the
            Instance editor but instead edit the SoundObject from the
            SoundObject Library that the instance points to, using the new
            green border/label to show that you are editing a Library object

    [new/updated] - when editing Library SoundObjects, now shows a text label
            that says "Editing Library SoundObject" to help further show that
            one is editing a SoundObject that might be pointed at by multiple
            instances

    [fix] - when auditioning soundObjects, was using disk render settings and
            not realtime render settings

    [fix] - when using blueLive, triggering ObjectBuilder objects would not
            generate score correctly

            (Thanks to Andrzej K for reporting this!)

    [new] - AudioFile SoundObject

            - Added Waveform display on timeline (renders waveform of audio file
            object; Thanks to Peiman Khosravi, Greg Thompson, John Lato, Oeyvind
            Brandtsegg, and others on the Csound list for their help on this!

            - Updated editor: added scrollpane for audiofile properties to make
            it more useful when SoundObject Editor area is small; fixed so that
            when editing a SoundObject that does not have a sound file set or
            an invalid one, to clear out the info area (was just leaving on
            values last set which was misleading)

    [new] - Added "Time Log" option to Help menu; selecting this from menu will
            report time when blue started as well as elapsed time since blue
            started in HH:MM:SS:MS format (useful to keep track of how much time
            you worked in blue, for those who like to keep track how much work
            we're doing!)

    [new] - Added "Show Time Log on Exit" option to Program Options; if enabled,
            will show the Time Log when program exits

    [new] - Added piece "Aurora" by Dave Seidel to examples/pieces/daveSeidel
            folder

    [new] - Added "Synchronize Presets" to presets dropdown menu; calling this
            will remove values within presets which are for widgets which no
            longer exist, as well as will add values to presets from widgets
            which now exist in the interface which did not when the preset was
            saved

    [new] - Added cpspch to orchestral composition library in ScoreUtilities.py,
            works like csound's cps2pch taking in a pch value for first arg and
            number for equal temperament for second arg (optional, defaults to
            12 et)

    [new] - Added Program Option for Java 2D acceleration, whether to use the
            default or use Open GL

    [updated] - Big improvement in speed of rendering of CSD

            - reduced unnecesary creation of Strings by using ensureCapacity
            with StrBuilder class

            - combined two regular expressions into one for single line comment
            stripping method which reduced time almost 45%

            (These changes may not be noticable unless your project contains
            large amounts of SCO text, i.e. when doing granular scores with
            CMask, generating large amounts of notes with Orchestral composition
            library, etc.)

    [updated] - changed look of polyObject bar to use smaller buttons with no
            borders decorated with right arrow icon to look more like a bread
            crumb bar

    [updated] - Updated Jython to 2.2.1

    [fix] - ScriptingUtils.py restored to lib/pythonLib (was accidentally
            deleted when upgrading to Jython 2.2)


>Notes for 0.117.0<
[released 2007.08.27]

blue

    [new] - Add ability to randomize BlueSynthBuilder, ObjectBuilder, and
            Effects; to randomize, set randomizable on any of the following
            widgets(this is set to randomizable by default):

            -Horizontal Slider
            -Horizontal Slider Bank
            -Knob
            -Vertical Slider
            -Vertical Slider Bank
            -XY Controller

            then in UI editor, when set to non-edit mode, right click to show
            popup menu and choose "Randomize"

    [new] - added -u commandline option to pass in a directory to use to store
            blue's configuration settings; by default blue used USER_HOME/.blue
            but this option was added so users can explicitly choose where to
            store settings (i.e. if you're going to run blue from a USB flash
            drive you can set your configuration dir to somewhere on the usb
            drive)

    [updated] - Upgraded to Jython 2.2

    [updated] - Removed -p commandline option as it wasn't very useful anymore
            (historically it was used to show which .blueConfig.xml to use, but
            this was before configuration settings were change to use a
            directory to store settings

    [updated] - Tracker - Shortcuts modified to be more like other trackers:

            -Insert key now adds a blank note and pushes down other notes

            -Entering a note with keyboard mode will now automatically select
            the next row after entering a note

            -BackSpace key will delete the current note and move all following
            notes up one row

            -Delete key will delete the current note and select the next row

    [updated/fix] - when blue loads, if any of the libraries are not loadable
            (Instruments, UDO, Script, Effects libraries), blue will now give an
            error message to fix or remove the corrupt file and exit out; this
            is done so that no overwriting of existing libraries or backup files

            (Thanks to Mark Van Peteghem for the bug report)

    [updated/fix] - Changed behavior when selecting SoundLayers, when focus is
            lost then selection will be deselected (prior behavior was that
            once a soundLayer was selected, the last one would always be
            selected unless one was removed or project files changed, which
            would just leave the selection always there which was distracting)

    [fix] - fixed mixer generation problem when Send signals were not being
            assessed correctly and branches of code were incorrectly optimized
            out

    [fix] - fixed problem when viewing in Score Navigator where complete text
            was being drawn even when past length of bar; fix was to set clip
            rect when drawing bars in preview mode

    [fix] - SoundLayer top row buttons should now look same size

    [fix] - Memory Leak - Some BSB Widget UI items did not remove themselves
            as propertyChangeListeners to BSB data classes

    [fix] - when opening dialog for render to disk when no filename given in
            project properties, set default to $HOME/output.wav for first time
            use (was defaulting to whatever last file was opened in any dialog)

manual

    [updated] - Updated keyboard shortcuts for Tracker

    [updated] - Added documentation about widget randomization to
            BlueSynthBuilder entry, as well as link to info from mixer section
            on working with effects

blue

    [new] - Added "Clear All" option to SoundLayer's Automation menu to remove
            all parameter automations for that SoundLayer

    [new] - Added Program Options Settings in General Tab for using custom
            browser command and what command to use; if enabled, the custom
            browser command will be used instead of blue's default system for
            opening URL's; browser command will have URL appended to it when
            opening URL's so if the browser is not on the path the user may
            have to designate an absolute path to the browser executable

    [updated] - Small optimization on drawing of parameter automation lines

    [updated/fix] - External and ObjectBuilder - redid generation of notes to
            fix problem reported on mailing list when on Linux

    [updated/fix] - blueX7 - removed the p3 modification in generated Csound
            code as it was unnecessary and reverted to original Pinkston
            duration code (was causing bugs when running in recent Csound and
            seems better performing now)

    [updated/fix] - Freezing - When unfreezing soundObjects, now checks project
            if there are any other references to the generated frozen audio
            file and only delete when there are no references left (so if
            you freeze an object, make a copy of the frozen object, then
            unfreeze one of the objects, the freeze audio file won't be deleted
            as there is still one reference to the audio file)

    [fix] - Freezing and Auditioning of SoundObjects did not correctly generate
            CSD when Automation was used; did not adjust values of automation
            data and would result in all automation data from time zero until
            end of piece to be generated, causing incorrect results

            (Thanks Jan Jacob, Michael, and others for reporting this issue!)

    [fix] - Expansion of SCO carry (".") now done first before expanding any
            other SCO symbols ("+", ">", "<")

            (Thanks Phil for reporting this issue!)

    [fix] - when changing color on Automation line, repaint was not happening
            correctly

    [fix] - Program Options were not loading the Utility Csound command
            correctly

blue

    [new] - BSB/Effects/ObjectBuilder - Added new TextField widget, value in
            textfield will be used as replacement value for object

    [new] - BSB/Effects - Now able to set if automation is allowed for widgets
            which are automatable.  Automatable widgets are enabled for
            automation by default to preserve older project behavior.  Disabling
            automationAllowed will not only disable but will also remove any
            automation data for that parameter.
            (Requested by Peiman Khosravi)

    [new] - Added piece "Owllight" by Dave Seidel to examples/pieces/daveSeidel
            folder

    [new] - Added piece "Phenomena" to examples/pieces/stevenYi folder

    [new] - Added techniques folder to examples, with following examples:

            -pvoc.blue - using automation to control resynthesis of pvx files

            -tapePiece.blue - using sample to do tape like manipulations

            -twelveTone.blue - demonstrates using SoundObject Library and
            NoteProcessors to achieve serial compositional operations

            -surfaces.blue - uses ObjectBuilder with python script to create
            surfaces as in Xenakis's Metastasis (uses Orchestral Composition
            Library)

    [new/updated] - Table editing behavior changed: on all tables, when editing
            a cell, if using tab or by other means to make the current edited
            cell lose focus, current value in editor will be committed;
            previously, the value in the editor would not be committed if tab
            used; this should allow for faster editing of values

            (Thanks to Jan Jacob Hofmann for the request!)

    [updated] - Tracker example (blue/examples/soundObjects/tracker.blue)
            updated with different music and use of effects

    [updated] - BlueSynthBuilder, Effects, and ObjectBuilder now default to
            edit enabled for code and GUI editing when initially created
            (Suggested by Bruce Petherick)

    [updated] - all tabbed panes will now switch to the tab that is dragged over
            when dragging an item (useful for when dragging a UDO from the
            library to an instrument and vice versa)

    [updated/fix] - Main frame shortcuts added to dialogs for individual Effects
            and Sends, so shortcuts like F9 and Ctrl-S will now work even when
            working on those effects and sends

    [updated/fix] - OSX - shortcuts for all textfields and other actions that
            were using CTRL should now use Apple Command key (i.e. copying and
            pasting in text fields is now CMD-C and CMD-V)

            (Thanks to Jan Jacob Hofmann for the request!)

    [fix] - "Edit Points" options for BSBLineObjects would not work when editor
            was in a dialog (i.e. when editing Effects in the Effects Library)
            (Reported by Peiman Khosravi)

    [fix] - When using BSB Knobs and double-clicking the display to edit the
            value by hand, value shown after double-clicking was incorrect

    [fix] - Python NoteProcessor was not throwing exception correctly, user
            would not get feedback dialog but instead would have to look at
            console (now fixed)

    [fix] - When adding Effects from library to Mixer, would not reset to
            enabled before inserting

    [fix] - When editing values for NoteProcessors, if value was cell was
            being edited and user moved away, table would not commit value and
            have editor up still for next SoundObject if it had the same number
            of NoteProcessors; misleading, behavior changed to commit any
            previous edits when a SoundObject is selected

    [new] - Added "Render to Disk and Play" command in program options under
            Disk Render Settings.  If enabled, blue will use the given command
            to play a file after "Render to Disk and Play" is used instead of
            the built-in SoundFile player.  Command given will have $outfile
            replaced with path of the rendered file.

    [new] - Added piece "Distant Stars" to examples/pieces/stevenYi folder

    [updated] - Script "Show Info Dialog" now made as a toggle to show and hide
            the info dialog; ctrl-shift-I shortcut added; dialog now allows all
            main frame shortcuts to work when dialog is open

    [updated] - Made ProgramOptions default to "dac" and "adc" so that first
            time blue users will have a sensible default when they first run
            the program

    [updated] - Disabled "Jobs" and "Utils" panels in SoundFileManager as they
            are not currently being used

    [FIX] - BlueSynthBuilders were not correctly generating instrument code for
            automation; bug introduced in 0.113.0

    [fix] - nudging SoundObjects up or down using arrow keys would lose
            selection

    [fix] - SoundObject editor would load editor for every selected object,
            making a group selection slow; now only shows if selecting a single
            object, otherwise hide the editor

blue

    [new] - Mixer now allows adding Sends anywhere in pre and post fader effects
            bins.  Sends must follow current mixer contract of no feedback so
            can only send forward down the chain. (Dropdown to select outchannel
            for mixer and send is auto-updated to prevent feedback). Send amount
            is automatable on main timeline.

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - Added SubChannel dropdown widget that will allow
            selecting a named subchannel to use as a replacement value in the
            BSB ORC code.  This is meant to be used with the subchannel form of
            blueMixerOut, i.e. if the dropdown has an object name of REVERB, the
            ORC code to use would be:

            blueMixerOut "<REVERB>", aleft * <REVERB_AMOUNT>, aright * <REVERB_AMOUNT>

            This allows an alternate way to do sends from the instrument rather
            than from the Mixer itself, and is useful if setting the send value
            by score parameter instead of setting within the mixer.

            It is recommended when using the subChannel form of blueMixerOut
            within instruments to use this widget instead of hardcoding the
            subchannel name as this will be portable across projects

    [new] - Added "Show Info Tabs Dialog" to Script Menu to make visible the
            info tabs dialog that scripts use in case it is closed

    [new] - Added <INSTR_NAME> blue variable that is the same as INSTR_ID but
            for named instruments does not generate quotes around value

    [new] - Script Library now supports drag and drop to manage scripts and
            script categories

    [updated] - Mixer generation code strategy reworked to better handle sends.
            Further mixer generation optimizations to not generate signal
            paths that won't be used. (i.e. if fader is set to 0 and not
            automated, remove rest of signal after fader from graph);
            documentation for mixer updated to describe optimization strategy

    [updated] - Presets - Presets for BSB/ObjectBuilder now save their held
            values in alphabetic order of value name; this was done so that
            when using with Source Control Management (i.e. Mercurial, SVN,
            etc.) there wouldn't be false positives on detecting changes
            (previously the values were coming out in whatever order the keys
            were mapped by HashMap which might change between loads of the
            project or library)

    [updated] - when importing instruments from blueShare, they will now go into
            an "Imported Instruments" folder instead of adding to the root of
            the user instrument library (matches behavior of what happens when
            importing effects)

    [fix] - BSB/ObjectBuilder XY object's view label showing x and y values was
            incorrectly displaying value (value held by object and generated by
            object was correct for ranges however)

    [fix] - Disallow subChannel to be named "Master" as it is reserved for
            master channel out

    [fix] - blueShare dialog would report a warning message to console when
            opened each time after the first time as dialog was recreated each
            time; now cached

internal

    -BSBObjectRegistry split into BSBObjectRegistry, EffectsObjectRegistry, and

            documentation for more information

    [new] - Instruments and Effects now have the ability to embed User-Defined
            Opcodes; user can safely reuse opcodes with same names and blue will
            check for duplicates and reuse when generating CSD's, as well as
            detect name clashes between UDO's and also replace names in code

    [new] - Edit Enabled state now maintained for BlueSynthBuilder and
                ObjectBuilder for code areas

    [new] - SoundObject names may now be multiline by using \n in name (care
            should be used when using this that SoundLayeer height be tall
            enough to show full name of SoundObject)

                      original (user inputs number of times to repeat)

            -Ctrl-Drag - If control is down when drag is initiated, copies of
                      originals will be added in place and drag will move
                      originals

    [new] - BSB/ObjectBuilder/Effects

            -Value display for Knobs, VSliders, HSliders now have tooltip text
            that popup when mouse is over the value display; shows full value
            of item in case it is cut off in the normal display

            -FileSelector widget will now open file chooser to location of the
            currently set file value

    [new] - When generating Effects as UDO's, now does check to see if
            equivalent UDO already exists and if so to reuse that

    [new] - Added <RENDER_START> blue variable, usable in Global SCO area (also
            in Global SCO area of instruments), replaced with render start time
            that blue uses (does not currently account for timewarped score)

    [new/updated] - Drag and Drop

            -added Drag and Drop to EffectsLibrary tree for moving effects and
            folders into other folders

            -Removed ">" Add from library on Orchestra and UDO panel, now drag
            and drop from library to panels

            -Now able to reorder items in libraries by dragging and moving

            -For dragging UDO from library to instrument UDO edit panel, start
            drag in UDO library, mouse over tabs to switch, then drop on UDO
            edit panel for instrument

    [new/updated] - UDOLibrary and All UDO EditPanels share same buffer for
            copy/paste operations; if UDO is copied on one edit panel, it will
            be pastable into any other or in the library; if a UDO Category is
            cut/copied from the library, it is only pastable in the Library

    [updated] - When SoundLayer has no automations, now does not show automation
            selector in layer edit panel (on left of timeline)

    [updated] - InfoDialog made editable when showing messages to allow for
            cutting/copying of text

    [updated] - when generating UDO's from Instruments and Effects, if an
            equivalent opcode is found (same inTypes, outTypes, and codeBody),
            the existing UDO will be reused and references to the new udo will
            be text swapped with the name of the existing UDO at compilation time;
            if an equivalent UDO does not exist but the new UDO's name is already
            in use, a unique name will be assigned and references to the new
            UDO's original name will be text swapped with the unique name at
            compilation time

    [FIX] - Dialog windows now allow for keyboard events to pass through to
            parent window (i.e. when using the soundObjectPropertyDialog, all
            menubar shortcuts in the main window will work so you can open the
            other dialogs using their shortcuts, press ctrl-s to save your
            document, etc.)

    [fix] - UDO's were not draggable in library and so could not be rearranged
            in folders

    [fix] - UDO's were not cloned when dragging from project to library, causing
            problems when dragging the same UDO multiple times to the library

    [fix] - BSB Dropown Widget was not checking selected index was within
            boundaries when updating contents of dropdoglobawn

    [fix] - DropDown editor for BSBDropdown widget now commits current edit when
            dialog closes

    [fix] - BSB File Selector would have null pointer errors after loading if
            object was saved with no selected files

blue

    [new] - Render Time Pointer now shows when using "Audition Sound Objects"

    [new] - blueMixerOut now able to take subchannel as first argument, must use
            quoted string for name, for example:

            blueMixerOut "audio1", aoutL, aoutR

            will send the audio out of this code to the Mixer SubChannel
            "audio1"; this allows users to route the output from Sound
            SoundObjects and AudioFile SoundObjects to subchannels created
            by the user in the Mixer

            (Thanks to Jim Credland for suggestion!)

    [new] - Added Apple OSX Application Handlers for Quit, Preferences, and
            About options from Program menu; hitting command-Q will now use
            blue's exit routine instead of directly shutting down the Java
            Virtual Machine

            (Thanks to Jim Credland for suggestion!)

    [new] - "Save Libraries" menu option added to File Menu; calling this will
            force a save of the User Instrument Library and User-Defined Opcodes
            Library (normally saves only on closing of blue)

            (Thanks to Jim Credland for suggestion!)

    [new] - BSB, ObjectBuilder, Effects - The Edit Enabled checkbox is now
            persistent so that if you are in the middle of editing the graphic
            interface for any of the above, then go away and come back, it will
            return to the last state of edit mode or usage mode

            (Thanks to Jim Credland for suggestion!)

    [new] - PianoRoll - added "Set Selected Notes" option in Properties tab to
            set the noteTemplate for selected notes in the Notes section

            (Thanks to Pia Kraft for suggestion!)

    [new] - Tracker - added two new options to popup menu shown from track
            header:

              Duplicate - duplicates the selected track
              Clear - clears all note data for track

            (Thanks to Pia Kraft for suggestion!)

    [new/fix] - Tracker - When changing name of column in track editor, value
            is now updated on Track Header in TrackList

            (Thanks to Pia Kraft for suggestion!)

    [updated] - Improved ScoreNavigator to show thumbnail background of score
            timeline; currently only renders SoundObjects and not grid lines or
            automations; slightly buggy and inefficient, but still more usable
            to show big picture view of timeline

    [fix] - BSB/ObjectBuilder/Effects - When loading HSlider and VSlider's,
            there was a problem to load the value correctly

    [fix] - SoundObjectLibrary - when loading, if a PolyObject was in the
            library that held and Instance of another SoundObject that was in
            the library but was to be loaded after the PolyObject, an exception
            occurred; changed to two-pass loading strategy (bug #1639186)

    [fix] - Examples - Etude did not have string-128 file in project directory

internal

    [updated] - Redid ScoreTimeCanvas to use event notification to add/remove
            SoundObjects to timeline (in preparation for user scripts)

documentation

    [updated] - Added note to OSX platform information on using F1-F12 keyboard
            shortcuts on recent version of OSX

>Notes for 0.111.0<
[released 2007.01.17]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Import MIDI File - Allows user to start a new blue project by
            importing from a MIDI file; MIDI note data is converted to SCO using
            note templates set by user (has reasonable defaults)

            (Thanks to Brent Boylan for the request!)

    [new] - Added new SoundLayerHeight options, available from popup menu
            activated from "V" arrow button above sound layers:

            -Set All Layer Heights - sets all layers to selected height index

            -Set Default Layer Height - sets the default layer height to use for
            new SoundLayers

    [fix] - Parameter Automation

            -when editing lines, was not correctly calculating max snapped
            value for parameters with resolution set

            -when setting resolution on widgets with resolution > 0, values in
            lines are now are remapped to closest point on resolution grid
            (rounding)

            -when setting value on widgets with resolution > 0, values are
            remapped to closest point on resolution grid (rounding)

            -Sliders (HSlider, VSlider, HSliderBank, VSliderBank) now allow
            negative resolutions; negative resolutions will default to using
            0.01 for the Slider's GUI, but will allow any value when automated

            -HSliderBank, VSliderBank - was not adding parameters for automation
            correctly when initially increasing number of sliders

            -Changed adding and editing of effects from mixer to use two
            different dialogs; adding works as before an allows a cancel option,
            while edit no longer has a cancel option;

            NOTE: Because of the new edit dialog having no cancel option,
            changes to the effect are made live and not when effect editor
            dialog is closed; previously the behavior was to allow cancel of
            edits, but this caused a bug with parameter automation and losing
            connection between the edited effect's widgets and its parameters

    [fix] - When deleting more than one SoundLayer, SoundObject views were not
             correctly removed

    [fix] - FindReplace Dialog would sometimes appear with text fields not
            laid out properly; redid dialog using Matisse

    [fix] - when dragging Instrument from project to library, was not making a
            copy

    [fix] - ScoreTimeCanvas: "Select Layer", "Select All Before", and "Select
            All After" were broken in 0.110.0 from the updated change to how
            SoundObject Views are handled

    [fix] - BlueLive

            - conversion of MIDI note to CPS was buggy due to integer division
            instead of float

            -conversion of MIDI note to PCH was incorrect and did not pad scale
            degree with zero if < 10

documentation

    [new] - Added "Importing MIDI Files" Section

    [updated] - updated information on shortcuts for Score Timeline section of
            manual as well as Score Timeline section of shortcuts page

    [updated] - redid Preface (was very outdated)

blue

    [new] - Parameter Automation - Editable automation of parameters (knobs,
            sliders, xy-controller from BSB and Effects, mixer volume) on
            timeline (see documentation for more information, also
            examples/features/automation1.blue for an example)

    [new] - BSB/ObjectBuilder

            - PresetManager now able to cut/copy/paste items in PresetsManager
            Dialog, as well as able to add groups in dialog and import/export
            item or folder to file

            - reworked to require all object names to have unique names for
            their replacement values and don't clash with any other object
            within that BSB or ObjectBuilder

    [new/updated] - Piano Roll

            - added labels for all notes in MIDI mode (Request 1604019 by
            Paolo)

            - added new green hilighter in row header for selected notes,
            follows selected notes when moved up and down to easier show what
            note is currently being edited

    [new/updated] - Redid blueLive interface, started work on MIDI SCO Pad to
            record MIDI data as SCO using note templates (not yet finished)

    [updated] - Redid SoundLayer User Interface; no longer uses JTable, instead
            using custom panels

    [updated] - Changed number of different height sizes for layers from 5 to 9

    [updated] - When setting min and max values for lines and BSB Objects that
            have these values, better checking is done and user is alerted if
            new boundary value crosses the other boundary, and option is shown
            to user to either rescale the values to the new min and max, or to
            keep values and truncate any that are outside of the boundaries to
            the boundary value

    [updated] - Render to Disk dialog stays open after finishing

    [updated] - Changed drawing strategy for TimeBar in main timeline and
            PianoRoll editor for speedup

    [fix] - When using "Render to Disk" or "Render to Disk and Play", now puts
            quotes around output file name

    [fix] - ProgramOptions Setting Dialog was setting values for RealTimeRender
            and DiskRender settings on global ProgramOptions even when window
            was closed or cancelled; now only saves values when OK button is
            selected

    [fix] - ProgramOptions Setting Dialog was not using saved window size
            correctly as it was incorrectly being reinstantiated every time it
            was opened

    [fix] - When editing line points using table from popup, setting y value was
            not respecting min and max values

    [fix] - BSB/ObjectBuilder - CheckBox item was not loading correctly from
            presets

    [fix] - Made parsing of nchnls more robust by trimming spaces before parsing

    [fix] - nchnls from realtime settings were always being used when rendering
            mixer code even when doing disk renders


internal

    [updated] - Reworked Note parsing and toString() methods; speed increase by
            about 3x (the Note class is a fundamental class and this speedup
            should improve CSD generation time)

    [updated] - Libraries and starter scripts updated

            -commons-lang library to 2.2
            -swing-layout to 1.0.1

    [updated] - LinePoint's y-values converted to be absolute instead of 0-1.0
            relative

    [updated] - BSBWidget values converted to be absolute isntead of 0-1.0
            relative

[released 2006.10.07]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Tracker SoundObject - uses Tracker paradigm of vertical tracks and
            note list editing; fit to work with Csound SCO; see documentation
            for more information and usage details (example added as
            blue/examples/soundObjects/tracker.blue)

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder/ObjectBuilder - Added new Horizontal and Vertical
            Slider Bank objects, allows to quickly create x number of sliders

            -added documentation to BlueSynthBuilder entry

    [new] - Python Orchestra - Added timeWarp function (takes in noteList and
            string with beat/tempo pairs); modified Performer and
            PerformerGroup's performAleatorically methods to take in
            optional timeString

    [new/updated] - For Blue's text editor, changed behavior when typing tab:
            instead of overwriting selected text with a tab, indent lines that
            have selected text by prepending tabs to the lines; also added
            shift-tab to remove leading tabs from selected lines or line where
            caret is currently positioned if no text is selected

    [new/updated] - CSD/ORC import
            - now parses UDO's and add's to project's UDO list
            - optimized code to run more efficiently

    [updated] - When editing library instruments, border for instrument editor
            turns green to help identify editing object from library

    [updated/fix] - Mixer Dialog now saves location of splitpane on exit

    [fix] - CSD/ORC import: if imported file has kr set but not ksmps, will
            deduce ksmps as sr/kr (previously ignored kr altogether)

internal

    [updated] - if External SoundObject has no commandline and no script text,
            return null NoteList instead of throwing Exception

    [updated] - Redid SoundObject and Instrument edit panels to lazily load
            editors; decrease startup time by not having to load until necessary


>Notes for 0.108.0<
[released 2006.08.26]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Added current play time display; when rendering in realtime, shows
            time in hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds format

    [new] - "Add Marker" option added to Project Menu; while rendering a project
            in Realtime, user can add a new Marker to where the current render
            time is by using menu option or shortcut ctrl-m (apple-m on OSX) if
            the currently shown project is the one being rendered

            Thanks to Menno for the request!

    [new] - Added "Audition Selected SoundObjects" to Project menu with shortcut
            ctrl-shift-A; if SoundObjects are selected, can audition to render
            just the selected SoundObjects; acts identically to using "Audition
            SoundObjects" from SoundObject popup menu, but now can use keyboard
            shortcut

    [new] - Now able to enable or disable effects via popup menu in Mixer
            Dialog; disabled effects will render text gray in Mixer's Effects list

    [new/fix] - When rendering with Csound, if Csound returns an error value
            blue will now show a message dialog informing the user that there
            was an error and view the Csound Output Dialog for more information;
            if project is set to Loop mode, upon error from Csound blue will
            not repeatedly try to render but will show message and stop the
            loop render

    [new/fix] - When using "Replace with SoundObject in Buffer" option from
            SoundObject popup, now will replace each selected soundObject with
            a copy of what is in the buffer (makes for easier replacement of
            multiple soundObjects)

    [fix] - NoteProcessorDialog's for editing NoteProcessor's on PolyObjects and
            on SoundLayers did not have the project's NoteProcessorChainMap set,
            so was unable to add, insert, or remove NoteProcessorChains when
            editing in those contexts

    [fix] - PatternObject - If using "Repeat" Time Behavior without a repeat
            point, note generation was incorrectly scaling notes to duration of
            last note instead of duration of pattern; note durations were off
            and any silence at the end of the pattern would be lost (Fix was
            in ScoreUtilities class)

    [fix] - Render Time Manager, only show if file currently being rendered is
            the for the project shown in editor

    [fix] - BlueEditorPane

            - when right-clicking to show popup, should not
            process as if mouse clicked in the text area; this would lose
            selection so "Add to Code Repository" was not working

            - when text is selected and using Opcode Popup to select opcode text
            or custom code, should replace text that was selected

    [fix] - When opening blue projects from version < 0.94.0, fail more
            gracefully if unable to restore properties for properties on objects
            no longer there (message printed to console instead of Exception
            thrown and load failure)


>Notes for 0.107.0<
[released 2006.07.17]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - User-Defined Opcode Library - Program-Wide library of User-Defined
            Opcodes, works like User Instrument Library; Drag UDO's from project
            to folder node in UDOLibrary to add to library, select in library
            and use > button to add to project

    [new] - Added "Make a Donation" link to Help Menu

    [new] - For ProgramOptions -> RealtimeRender Settings, implemented [...]
            buttons for discovering audio in/out devices and midi in/out
            devices; when button is pressed, blue will try to discover the
            available devices for the selected driver and if blue was able to
            find them, the user will be shown a selection box from which to
            select the device

    [updated] - Updated RealtimeRender Settings Panel to only show audio and
            MIDI drivers that would be available on users system (i.e. Windows
            users don't see CoreAudio as an option, Linux users don't see
            WinMME, etc.)

    [updated] - in UDO Manager, editing name of Opcode in project moved from
            the editor for UDO's to the UDO list

    [updated] - When editing library UDO, border for UDO editor turns green to
            help identify editing object from library

    [updated] - ProgramOptions - redid UtilitySettings as a separate Panel
            class, added ability to select Csound Executable with a file
            selector to match how it is done in disk and realtime render
            settings

    [fix] - When selecting a group node (folder) in the User Instrument library,
            clear selection in Orchestra and clear Instrument editor

documentation

    [updated] - ProgramOptions information for RealtimeRenderSettings has been
            updated to discuss auto-detect features for audio/MIDI devices;
            a note has been added to make aware to the user to make sure the
            driver is not only selected but also enabled (this note was added
            due to user feedback on bluemusic-user mailing list; thanks!!!)

            author

    [updated] - ProgramOptions - settings for -b and -B default to OS defaults
            used by Csound (Linux: 256:1024, OSX: 1024:4096,
            Windows: 4096:16384) if first time using new ProgramOptions

    [updated] - Updated all example files to use new render system

blue

    [new] - New Render System

            - Many Render Settings are configurable by GUI; Program Options
            mostly set default settings for new Projects except for realtime
            render settings, which are to be used on a proram wide level;
            Projects have the option for complete override to set commandline
            to match older workflow

    [new] - Reorganized Program Options Dialog with new settings for Rendering,
            added ability to turn message colors on and off (off by default,
            which should always be set to off when using with blue and the
            Csound Output Dialog)

    [new] - Added buttons next to Advanced Settings to open up CommandFlags
            documentation; requires Csound Documentation Root to be set in
            ProgramOptions (feature requested by Andres Cabrera)

    [new] - Add SoundFile Preview to FileChooser Dialogs (Feature requested by
            Will Light)

    [new] - Python NoteProcessor - Use python code to process noteList generated
            by SoundObject; blue NoteList class is introduced to python
            interpreter before processing as variable "noteList" and that holds
            blue Note classes; methods for NoteList and Note are the same as in
            the Java classes; please see Java code for NoteList and Note for
            more information, or also see Python NoteProcessor documentation

            -example added in examples/noteProcessors/pythonProcessor.blue

    [new] - Added shortcut (Ctrl-l) and Project menu option to toggle loop
            rendering for project (requested by Menno)

    [new/updated] - TextArea's that use BlueEditorPane now paste for when
            clicking with middle mouse button (requested by Andres Cabrera)

    [new/fix] - when opening a project using either "Open" or Recent Files menu
            that is already open, now switches to the open project

    [fix] - for older projects, always set mixer to disabled regardless of if
            ProgramOptions is set to enable mixer by default or not

    [fix] - for projects which have no instruments in their orchestra (i.e. if
            a project is only using Sound SoundObjects), if mixer is enabled, do
            not generate any mixer code as it won't be used

blue

    [new] - ProgramOption added for setting Mixer enabled by default for new
            projects; value set to default to false

    [updated] - blueX7 now defaults to using blueMixerOut

    [fix] - Popups for Remove/Cut/Copy on BlueSynthBuilder, ObjectBuilder, and
            EffectsEditor were not functioning correctly; also modified popup
            to only show when right-click is on a selected object

    [fix] - On OSX, shortcuts in blue's code editor were adding an additional
            key type when processing, i.e. typing command-x would cut the text
            but then insert an x, command-a would select all but then insert an
            a and overwrite the inserted text

    [new] - For PolyObjects in the PolyObject bar, now can right-click and
            choose "Edit NoteProcessors" to open up a dialog to edit the
            noteProcessors for that PolyObject, including the root PolyObject
            (thus allowing applying NoteProcessors globally to a project);
            PolyObjects with NoteProcessors will now show up as having an
            asterisk before their name in the PolyObject bar

    [new] - For all SoundLayers in a PolyObject, now able to apply
            NoteProcessors to apply to all notes generated by SoundObjects on
            that SoundLayer; new column added to SoundLayer table found on left
            side of Score GUI marked as "NP"; info in that column shows number
            of NoteProcessors applied to that SoundLayer; double-click column
            to open up NoteProcessorChain editor for that SoundLayer

    [new] - For all LineObjects (LineObject, ZakLineObject, BSBLineObject),
            now able to edit point values using table editor; when
            right-clicking on the LineCanvas and not on a point, popup menu
            gives option to "Edit Points" which will then pop open a line point
            editor dialog for the currently selected line

    [updated] - SoundObject Editor removed from SoundObject Library Dialog;
            to edit soundObjects, double-click and soundObject editor in main
            frame will be used to edit (hilighted with green border).
            SoundObjectProperty Dialog will also show properties for item,
            allowing one to edit time properties and NoteProcessors for that
            library object (was not previously possible)

    [updated] - Mixer - if channel fader value is 0.0db, then don't apply mixer
            multiplication by 1.0f to save one multiplication in processing

    [updated] - SoundObject Library

            - When making an Instance of a SoundObject from the SoundObject
            library, Instance object now copies background color of SoundObject

            - Library shows short name for type of SoundObject (i.e.
            "GenericScore" instead of "blue.soundObject.GenericScore")

    [updated] - For OSX, switched from using hard reference to CTRL key to using
            Toolkit.getMenuShortcutKeyMask(); shortcuts should now use Command
            key instead of CTRL on OSX (may still need further work)

    [updated] - Removed Print option from File Menu

    [updated/fix] - TempoMapper now used when reading time from Csound and
            updating blue's time pointer; supports t-statements if found in
            global sco section of globals editor

            (Thanks to Istvan Varga and Victor Lazzarini for their help!)

    [fix] - Some places where float values were very close to zero were
            outputting values as scientific notation, consistent with Java but
            inconsistent with Csound; areas fixed included the Note Class for
            duration (p3), LineObject and ZakLineObject, and BSB Objects in both
            compilation phase and also in their UI's (Knob, HSlider, VSlider,
            XYController, Line)

    [fix] - Mixer channel fader values were saved but not loaded correctly, also
            values were properly set for faders but the label was not being
            updated

            (Thanks to Will Light for reporting this bug!)

    [new] - new options added to EffectsPopup for Mixer:

            - Add New Effect - Adds a new effect directly to project, using
            Effect Editor Dialog to edit

            - Open Interface for Effect - opens the GUI for the effect (same
            operation as double-clicking effect)

            - Edit Effect - Edits the selected effect using Efect Editor Dialog

            (Thanks to Kevin Welsh for the requests!)

    [new] - if SoundObject has Time Behavior of Repeat and Repeat Point is used,
            SoundObject Renderer now renders triangles to show where the
            SoundObject repeats

    [new/updated] - Settings for Windows and Dialogs (x, y, width, height,
            splitter locations, etc.) are now saved (used to be only x, y, width
            and height of main frame)

    [updated] - When using blueShare to import effects, effects are now imported
            into "Imported Effects" Group

    [fix] - changed horizontal scrollbars for Mixer channel effects bin to use
            smaller size (like their vertical scroll bars)

    [fix] - use of MessageFormat for outputting Mixer fader values defaulted to
            user's locale, which for some locales resulted in number formats
            where "," is used for decimal point instead of "." which Csound
            expects

    [fix] - when importing Effects from project into library, Library dialog
            would not show imported effects if it was previously opened until
            next restart of blue

    [fix] - when removing effects or effect groups in Effects Library, now
            clears out Effect Editor so that no editing for an effect that's
            been removed will be there

    [fix] - Mixer was not generating correct Csound code; blueMixerOut was not
            mixing signals but doing simple equals, resulting in only allowing
            one note instances signal out into the mixer chain; fixed to mix and
            also clear signals at end of chain

    [fix] - ZakLineObject was not generating correct line generating instruments
            for different zak channels so that signals would all go out the same
            zak channel

    (Big thanks to Will Light for reporting the above bugs!)

>Notes for 0.104.00<
[released 2006.03.14]

Steven Yi-----------------------------------------------------------------------

blue

    [new] - Effects System added to Mixer; create graphical UI's and code with
            Csound to create Effects which can be added pre-/post-fader to mixer
            Channels, SubChannels, and Master channel; Effects are created and
            managed in the Effects Library, and one can trade Effects through
            blueShare (please view updated documentation on the Mixer for more
            information)

    [new] - Mixer option for Extra Render Time added; user can set to add extra
            time end of score here so that effects with time delay (such as
            reverbs) will have enough time to finish out processing

    [new] - added limited undoability on add/remove of instruments in orchestra;
            will not work if instrument id changes, good for undoing an
            immediate mistake

    [updated/fix] - when rendering CSD to disk or file, use disk render settings
            which also prevents blue timepointer instrument from being generated

    [updated] - examples/features/mixerText.blue renamed to mixer.blue; example
            now uses Effect on Master channel as well as demonstrates using
            extra render time

    [fix] - Score Navigator was causing errant adjustments when resizing the
            navigator dialog

    [fix] - BSB Vertical Slider was not correctly loading saved height value
            (Thanks to Kevin Welsh for the bug report!)

    [fix] - Mixer was outputing scientific notation for multipliers when fader
            values were <= -60db (thanks Menno for the bug report!)

    [fix] - pasting of soundObjects from copy buffer after changing timeline
            zoom caused incorrect start times for pasted soundObjects

    [fix] - Using Shift soundObject option sometimes resulted in
            NullPointerError if right after a selection made

documentation

    [updated/new] - Mixer documentation expanded to explain Effects system and
            Extra Render Time

    [updated] - Pch generation options for PianoRoll were further expanded upon
            to include information on the MIDI option

    [new] - "Set Color" menu option added to SoundObject Popup on Score
            Timeline; allows to set color of all selected soundObjects

    [new] - SoundFont Viewer Dialog completely reworked to use tables to show
            instruments and presets in SoundFont

    [new] - PianoRoll

            -Added MIDI pitch generation option; disregards scale and uses MIDI
            values (0-127; 60 = C5 = Middle-C); outputs midi note number for
            <FREQ>

    [new] - FTable Converter - available from the Tools menu, this utility
            converts ftable statements (f-statements) into ftgen statements;
            based on the author's web page utility at:

            http://www.csounds.com/stevenyi/ftable.html

    [updated/fix] - SoundFont Viewer code was only grabbing from stdout pipe;
            csound5 changed to use stderr for printing messages; code changed
            to grab from both stdout and stderr to work with csound5 as well as
            csound versions based on csound4; code for grabbing redone to
            prevent lockups on Windows

    [fix] - Mixer was not respecting nchnls set in project

    [fix] - BSBFileWidget was not saving textFieldWidth property correctly

    [fix] - Tooltips for ScoreTimeCanvas were showing incorrect information for
            duration and end time

    [fix] - CSD Rendering order reordered so that global duration (duration of
            generated score (equivalent to <TOTAL_DUR>) and also duration of sco
            in global sco) is calculated correctly; timepointer now scrolls for
            duration of complete score time

            settings for animation rate and adjustment for latency added to
            ProgramOptions (see documentation for more details)

    [new] - "Audition Selected SoundObjects" option added; when right clicking
            on a selected SoundObject, new Audition option available to render
            selected SoundObjects using Real-Time settings; quickly listen to
            individual SoundObjects or sets of SoundObjects.  To stop
            auditioning, click anywhere on the ScoreTimeline or use the stop
            button.

    [new] - Added Program Options for Disk Render defaults, reorganized panel
            to separate out Real-Time Render Defaults, General Defaults

    [new] - Added Program Options for Utility; Csound Excecutable is used by
            blue for what to call when doing utility methods such as freezing or
            for the SoundFont Utility; Freeze Flags used for when freezing, so
            user can set to choose settings (i.e. use Float 32-bit instead of
            default)

            (Freeze Flags suggested by Bill Beck)

    [new] - Support for Csound Score Expressions (see

    [new] - AudioFile dependency check done when opening files; for all
            AudioFile soundObjects that have references to files which can not
            be found, a dialog now shows where users can set replacement files
            for the missing files by double clicking the row and choosing the
            file from a file chooser dialog

    [new] - "Import from ORC/SCO" option added from File menu

    [new/fix] - bracket matching in text editor was not showing due to it
             defaulting to the color black (same as background); now set to
             match user's setting for default text color

    [new/fix] - on Score Timeline, when a group of soundObjects are selected,
            it is now possible to deselect a selected soundObject by shift-
            clicking it

    [updated/fix] - text hilight color for selected text was too bright in
            BlueEditorPane

    [fix] - BlueEditorPane was not correctly calculating length of lines; was
            not considering number of characters each tab expands to

    [fix] - CSD Import - ksmps was not being parsed from CSD's

    [fix] - Set minimumSize on BlueEditPane to 0,0 so that split panes that held
            objects using BlueEditPane could resize down to zero

            New example for using CommonMusic with blue via the External
            object contributed by Stephane Boussage

          -examples/features/soundObjectLibrary_twelveTone.blue

            Example showing usage of SoundObjectLibrary, also some python
            script

          -examples/scripting/feldman.blue

            Demonstrates usage of python script to emulate Morton Feldman's
            early composition graphic score technique

          -examples/soundObjects/lineObject2.blue

            Another lineObject example that shows using lineObjects to
            control frequency cutoff of filters

    [new] - Add "Select All Before" and "Select All After" menu options to
            SoundLayer popup to be able to select soundObjects before or after
            where point clicked

    [new] - removed Emacs shortcuts in BlueEditorPane, removed from Program
            Options as well

    [updated] - Added "Select Layer" menu option to SoundLayer popup (still able
            to use double-click on soundLayer to select all soundObjects on that
            layer)

    [updated] - Replaced text editor with one based on JEditTextArea

            -now supports syntax highlighting in other syntaxes

            -PythonObject and PythonInstrument syntax highlight for Python

            -RhinoObject and RhinoInstrument syntax highlight for JavaScript

            -External SoundObject allows choosing syntax type from popup menu
            (defaults to Python)

            -ObjectBuilder SoundObject highlights in Python when not set to
            External; when set to External, allows syntax type options from
            popup menu (defaults to Python)

            -Fixed bugs with semi-colon text area commenting

            -Faster hilighting

    [updated] - Changed save behavior; if file has not yet been saved, using
            ctrl-s and the menu option was previous disabled; now it is usable,
            but if not yet saved, will perform the same operation as the
            "Save As" menu option

    [updated] - Removed blueSoundFileManager starter scripts

    [updated/new] - BSBLineObject

            -Removed isCommaSeparated and replaced with Dropdown option to
            choose separator type; options include None, Comma, and Single
            Quote; the new Single Quote option allows for using the generated
            text in Csound Macro calls

            -Added Lock Points option; when points are locked, new points can
            not be added and old ones can not be removed, but existing points
            can still be modified

            (Thanks to Bill Beck for the suggesting the above!)

    [updated] - Allow opening multiple .blue files

    [fix] - FrozenSoundObject was generating an instrument that used either
            "out" or "outs" opcode; this did not work for projects with more
            than 2 channels, so for any frozen sound object that uses more than
            one channel, use "outc" opcode instead

            (Thanks to Bill Beck for finding the bug and letting me know what
            the appropriate fix is!)

    [fix] - Freezing feature badly assumed that the only files in the directory
            where a project was that were named starting with "freeze" were
            those generated by blue; would cause NumberFormatException and not
            freeze a soundObject

    [fix] - when selecting item in User Instrument Library, if item was selected
            in Project Orchestra table, it would properly deselect it, but it
            would also do another call to clear the selection in the User
            Instrument Library

    [fix] - BlueEditorPane - Inserting text that replaced current word was doing
            so by one character too early (would chomp newline of previous line)

    [fix] - ZakLineObject and LineObject - AbstractLineObject base class had
            incorrect caching system for caching instruments and tables,
            resulting in wrong control signals being generated if lines had
            same table values but different line variable names

    [fix] - UDORepositoryBrowser was not able to run on Java 1.4 as code was
            using Java 5 code for setting layout and adding to content pane

    [fix] - Prevent IndexOutOfRange error when selecting layers

            their own soundObjects; python code works as in pythonObject and
            "score = myScore" required; external code works as in External
            Object; can convert existing PythonObject and External SoundObjects
            to ObjectBuilder via soundObject popup menu

            -Example added in examples/soundObjects folder

            -Documentation added to User Manual

    [new] - added initial examplePlugin "Plugin SDK" to all release files

    [updated] - Drawing code for timebar redone to not draw time labels if
            zoomed out enough to cause labels to overlap (for Score Timeline and
            PianoRoll timeline)

    [updated] - ExternalObject - Added undo, redo, and shorcut for testing
            soundObject, respectively accessed by ctrl-z, ctrl-shift-z, and
            ctrl-t

    [fix] - align soundObjects option was not working unless soundObjects on
            timeline were moved and motionbuffered; now works immediately after
            selection


internal

    [updated] - changed adding of instrument to orchestra to defer
             instantiation until when adding a new instrument

    [fix] - continuing to fix up jar plugin code

blue

    [new] - added Toaster project classes to pop up message in lower right;
            used currently when "Rendering to disk" (needs work, seems to show
            on Windows but not on Linux)

    [new] - LineObject - tables generated for lines in LineObject are cached so
            that if a generated table matches exactly another one already
            generated, the first one is reused (i.e. ten instances of a
            LineObject in the library on the timeline will only generate those
            tables once when compiling a CSD)

    [new] - Added pushing up and down of UDO's in UDO Table

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - XY Controller - emits two values, one for x and
            one for y value; replacement value in instrument code is the
            XY Controller's ObjectName + "X" and "Y" for x,y values respectively

    [updated] - BlueSynthBuilder - BSBObjects may emit more than one replacement
            value, so when using ctrl-shift-space in the code editors, now shows
            what replacement values are available, not just objectName's
            (though, for most cases besides the XY Controller, the BSBObject
            does only use the objectName)

    [fix] - SoundObjects were not getting sorted in their SoundLayers before
            rendering out to CSD, breaking assumption that soundObjects would
            generate in time order

    [fix] - SoundObjects in SoundObject Library did not have all generate
            methods called, only generateNotes, breaking compilation for
            soundObjects that relied on other generate functions being called
            first to do internal precompilation (i.e. LineObject)

    [fix] - soundfiles in SFDIR were not being found correctly; redid search for
            Environment Variables using code from
            http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0150.html

internal

    [fix] - Jar Plugin Class Loader fixed

    [updated] - Continuing with refactoring of code to Actions

blue

    [new] - Added Markers and MarkersList; can add markers to timeline by
            shift-clicking on timebar, change marker time by clicking and
            dragging.  Can set properties of marker by using Markers List,
            available from Windows menu or Shift-F4.  Can set start time to
            marker time as well as delete marker by using right-click on table
            to open popup. Names of markers show up current as a tooltip when
            rolling over the marker on the timeline. Can move to next and
            previous marker on ScoreTimeline by using <| and |> buttons.

    [new] - added Score Navigator; navigate score timeline using mini-window
            (shortcut of Shift-F3 to open/close the window)

    [new] - Added incremental search from MySwing to BlueEditorPane

            -ctrl-i = Case-Sensitive Search
            -ctrl-shift-i = Case-Insensitive Search

    [updated] - Added undoability to BlueSynthBuilder text editors

    [updated] - improved performance of ScrollableOutputTextArea, used by
             console output windows when rendering

    [updated] - When setting RenderStartTime, RenderEndTime, or dragging
            Markers, now will scroll the time line

    [fix] - shortcuts for tabs (ctrl 1-7) were not correct and did not have
            shortcut for UDO Tab

    [fix] - Render to Disk and Play - File was not being found in SFDIR
            correctly

            initialized to zero.

            -Added optional startOffset parameter to
            Performer::performAleatorically so that performer can be told to
            start at a later time (parameter works with
            PerformerGroup::performAleatorically).  Value initialized to zero.

    [new] - added same shortcut keys for timeline zooming on score time canvas
            to PianoRoll (see timeline zoom for shortcuts, both sets are
            available)

    [update] - extra set of zoom shortcuts were added for those with conflicts
            of shortcuts with their window manager

    [fix] - blueShare - on Import, was not showing display due to bad key lookup
            of internationalized text

    [fix] - RenderStartTime and RenderEndTime were not updating visually when

blue

    [new] - ZakLineObject - LineObject for generating values that work with Zak

            (Contributed by Michael Bechard)

    [new] - added Disk Render Options to Project Properties to allow for
            different options when rendering project to sound file on disk than
            when rendering in realtime(i.e. use 64-bit csound, different sr,
            ksmps = 1, etc.)

    [new] - Render to Disk option added to File menu; uses Disk Render Options
            from Project Properties to generate CSD and call user-given
            command line, with the assumption that the user-given commandline is
            one that renders to disk

    [new] - double-clicking soundLayer in scoreTimeline will clear soundObject
            selections and select all soundObjects on that layer

    [updated] - CsoundOutputDialog - no longer shows on begining of render; user
            able to hide/show the dialog by using the "Windows->Csound Output
            Dialog" menu option or using the F7 shortcut

    [updated] - Upgraded Jython library to 2.2alpha1 (fixed random bugs with
            PythonObject and Java 5)

    [updated] - Removed CsOptions from Project Properties, no longer generated
            to CSD

    [fix] - LineObjects that did not have color values were throwing
            NullExceptionErrors

            (Contributed by Michael Bechard)

    [fix] - Added commons-lang-2.0.jar to starter scripts; without it, bugs were
            showing up in BlueSynthBuilder instruments, possibly elsewhere

    [fix] - CsoundOutput was getting cut off prematurely when process exited

    [fix] - made message dialogs opened from BlueMainFrame properly modal

    [fix] - Multi-line comments /* */ in scores was not being parsed correctly
            when generating NoteLists

            Cabrera)


>Notes for 0.99.2<
[released 2005.07.15]

blue

    [new] - CsoundOutputDialog - shows output from Csound when rendering instead
            of to console.  Option able to be set from ProgramOptions.

            (Contributed by Michael Bechard)

    [new] - Now able to change color of SoundObjects on timeline (editable on
            soundObject property dialog)

[released 2005.07.10]

blue

    [new] - now displays render loop time in main tool bar
            (suggested by Kevin Welsh)

    [new] - shortcuts for zooming the timeline (timeline or soundobjects must
            have focus for these to work):

            ctrl-equals - increase horizontal zoom
            ctrl-minus - decrease horizontal zoom
            ctrl-shift-equals - increase vertical zoom
            ctrl-shift-minus - decrease vertical zoom

            (suggested by Kevin Welsh)

    [new] - shorcuts added to switch managers (tabs)

            alt-left - previous manager
            alt-right - next manager

            (suggested by Kevin Welsh)

    [fix] - Orchestra Manager - If instruments shared an Instrument ID, if the
            user wanted to change the ID of an instrument that was not the first
            one with that ID, when going to change it would incorrectly change
            the ID of the first instrument with that ID


>Notes for 0.99.0<
[released 2005.07.09]

blue

    [new] - now able to Paste SoundObjects as SoundObjects in addition to being
            able to paste as PolyObjects; ctrl-click now shortcut for paste
            soundObjects and shift-click is now for pasting as PolyObject

    [new] - PatternObject SoundObject - a pattern-oriented score editor, based
            on the author's previous project "Patterns".

    [new] - AutoBackup - temp backups of open projects are now genereated every
            minute.  If blue quits unexpectedly, those files will remain,
            otherwise on normal closing of the file they are deleted.  If on
            opening a file a backup if found with a date newer than the original
            file, the option to open from the backup or the original is given.

            If the backup is chosen, it is required to use "Save As" to save
            over the original file or to a new file.  At that point the backup
            is deleted.

            If the original file is chosen, then the backup file will be
            overwritten the next time the autobackup thread runs.

            (Feature suggested by Bill Beck)

    [new] - Menu option and shortcut added for switching projects

            Ctrl-Shift-Page Up - Previous Project

    [fix] - "Convert to GenericScore" option did not create instruments or
            generate score correctly

    [fix] - If render start time and end time was set, score may not have been
            generated correctly when rendering CSD (notes with negative start
            times would be generated if render start time was within a
            soundObject; did not affect if render start time was 0 or not within
            a soundObject)

    [fix] - ScannedSynthesisMatrixEditor did not properly open due to bad key
            when looking for resource label

    [fix] - Generating CSD with .blue file that had spaces in name or spaces
            in directory name would cause error (rewrote Runtime.exec call)

    [fix] - TuningProcessor was unable to open Scale Selector due to bad key
            lookup in language files

    [fix] - Orchestra Panel - when rolling over blank area, toolTip would throw
            IndexOutOfBounds exception

    [new] - UDO Manager - Import from UDO Repository - using "I" button will
            open up a UDO browser that will connect to the repository on
            csounds.com; user is then able to browse the collection, and if
            finding a UDO they like, they are able to import directly to the
            current blue project

    [new] - changed default memory for JavaVM in starter scripts to 32meg
            initial and 256meg max

    [updated] - jython.jar replaced

    [fix] - all dialog popups now properly modal (i.e. generating CSD to screen,
            soundObjectExceptions

    [fix] - UDO Manager

          - made it capable of right clicking anywhere in table's area, not just
            on row items

          - when opening up projects prior to 0.98.1, if project had no UDO's,
            was causing a Null pointer exception and preventing opening of
            project

    [fix] - Orchestra Manager - When removing instrument from orchestra, table
            would not update correctly



>Notes for 0.98.1<

            editor; can cut/copy/paste items via popup menu using right-click

            When opening older projects, blue will parse existing UDO text,
            stripping comments not found within UDO code bodies

    [new] - BlueEditorPane - add/remove line comments (";") to a line or
            selected lines by using ctrl-; or ctrl-shift-;

            lookup, ctrl-; for commenting lines, and ctrl-shift-; for uncommenting
            lines

    [updated] -updated UDOManager documentation


>Notes for 0.98.0<
[released 2005.05.16]

blue

    [new] - Loop Render and Render Stop Time - using right mouse button instead
            of left in setting the time on a root polyobject will set a yellow
            line for when to stop rendering (green line is render start time);
            setting to loop mode before rendering will re-render the project
            immediately after a render stops.  This allows one to render in a
            loop and while listening, make a small change, and hear the change
            in the next loop (file is always recompiled to CSD between renders)

    [new] - Rewind button - sets renderStartTime to 0.0 and clears renderEndTime

    [update] - when generating CSD to file (ctrl-g), use same renderStartTime
            and renderEndTime as is currently set in the project

internal

    [new] - Only call generateNotes, generateFTables, generateInstruments, and
            generateGlobals for SoundObjects which could possibly contribute
            notes to the final CSD (if soundObject's startTime < renderEndTime
            && soundObject's endTime > renderStartTime); speeds up renders of
            project when using renderStartTime and renderEndTime by not
            calling those methods unnecessarily


>Notes for 0.97.1.2<
[released 2005.05.13]

blue

    [fix] - PythonInstrument and RhinoInstrument was not returning an instance
            of PythonInstrument on loadFromXML

    [new] - Find/Replace Dialog added to BlueEditPane; open with ctrl-f

    [new] - Python SoundObject - Now catching PyExceptions (exceptions from
            running python code, i.e. undefined variables, bad syntax, etc.) and
            displaying to user via SoundObjectException display dialog

    [updated] - AudioFile editor now sets selected file as relative to project

            Orchestra, deselect any items from the other (makes knowing what
            the currently edited instrument is easier to see)

    [fix] - blue was not setting if save allowed correctly (Save menu option)

    [fix] - import from CSD was not updated to use new user instrument library
            setup; caused null pointer exception and did not work

internal

    [fix] - when selecting soundObjects on timeline, marquee was not correctly
            being moved offscreen, interfering with drag operations and using
            rt-click to bring up popup menus (if you clicked anywhere the
            marquee was before it disappeared blue would think that you were
            selecting a non-soundObject)

    [fix] - fixed marquee selection in BlueSynthBuilder as well

    [fix] - listing of scales in TuningProcessor now are alphabetical

    [new] - SoundObjectLibrary - Added Copy button to make copy of soundObject

    [new] - TuningProcessor - NoteProcessor converts values in a pfield
            according to settings from a Scala tuning file; able to set base
            frequency from noteProcessor; values to convert from are in pch-like
            notation:

                oct.scaleDegree

            where oct is octave (8 == baseFrequency, which defaults to Middle-C
            below A440), and scaleDegree is degree of scale to use (which
            interval in Scala file).  Scala file is chosen from files found in
            user's .blue directory under the scl directory
            (i.e. /home/steven/.blue/scl).  Documentation added to manual.

            default to being enabled

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - new DropdownList object, able to have items with
            name and value

    [new/updated] - Instance soundObjects no longer append "Instance: " to
            soundObject they are an instance of; now using different renderer
            on timeline to differentiate them from other soundObjects (top left
            corner cut out)

    [updated] - when replacing instruments into Arrangment, selected row stays
            hilighted to make further replacements easier to do

            generate an instrument or note

    [fix] - CeciliaModule - fixed replacement scheme for ftable nums

    [fix] - Sound soundObject - when loading pre 0.94.0 files, may have failed
            to open due to instrumentNumber field being changed to transient;
            changed back to non-transient

    [fix] - making copies of PolyObjects that contained Instance objects of
            SoundObjects in the SoundObject library would have instances

            ScoreMouseProcessor to use AlphaMarquee class

    [updated] - when adding to SoundObjectLibrary, now replaces current object

            up a BSB instrument, thus interface may not have been scrollable
            until and object was moved around or inserted/removed; call to
            recalculateSize was added to fix

    [fix] - Opcode Completion Popup - there was a case where using ctrl-space
            to do opcode completion could result in a index error when no text
            was found before the caret

            be added to this menu.

    [new] - added initial documentation on blueVariables to user manual

    [new] - NoteProcessorChains - From SoundObjectPropertyDialog, when editing
            NoteProcessors for soundObject, now able to save the current chain
            with name, insert a copy of a chain that has been previously been
            saved, and remove chains that have been previous saved;

            Note ProcessorChains are saved with the project and are accessible
            globally within project

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - added tabs for editing instrument global orc and
            globl sco code

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - now able to select multiple objects and move
            around together (added generic classes to reuse elsewhere as well
            to handle these types of operations)

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - added "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", and "Remove"
            options, able to do operations on group of objects; keyboard
            shortcuts were added to speed up using these operations:

            cut        - ctrl-x
            copy       - ctrl-c
            paste      - ctrl-click (paste will occur at mouse location)
            remove     - delete key

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - added Align panel to align selected objects by
            side or by centers, also distribute by either sides or centers

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - Label object now uses JLabel to render text; this
            causes the label to be bold my default, but also allows for the
            label to be richly formatted by using HTML (please see:

            http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/html.html

            for more information)


    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - added keyboard nudging of selected objects using
            keyboard arrows; if shift is down, moves by 10 pixels, other wise
            moves by 1 pixel

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - added selection of objects by marquee


    [new] - RotateProcessor - noteProcessor that rotates order of notes of
            soundObject; able to use positive or negative indexes to indicate
            new start note; documentation added to help under "User's Manual" ->
            "Reference" -> "NoteProcessors"

    [update] - removed "ix" BlueVariable and replaced with "<INSTR_ID>" to make
            consistent with how other variables are named and used

    [update] - SoundObject library resets soundObjects startTime to 0.0 when
            added to library, so that when previewing generated score with
            instances, the score value will more closely resemble the output
            (does not affect anything else about library soundObject usage)

    [fix] - when generating globalSco from instruments, incorrect method was
            used for replacing "ix" with correct instrument id which could cause
            exception in the case when globalSco was given but "ix" feature not
            used; also, instruments with named-instrument id did not correctly
            replace with i "name" but replaced with iname (no quotes)

blue

    [new] - added CheckBox object to blueSynthBuilder instrument; outputs either
            1 or 0 value depending if selected or not

    [new] - added links on help menu to "Report a Bug" and "Request a Feature"

    [new] - added timeDisplay and timeUnit properties to PolyObject; editable
            from popupMenu where Snap is edited, it allows to change how time is
            displayed at top time bar, whether to show units as time or simply
            numbers, and at what increment (integer value); by setting
            timeDisplay to "Number", and unit to 4, one's time view can be more
            like bars rather than time

    [new] - BlueSynthBuilder - while editing code, pressing ctrl-shift-space
            will pop open a list of objectNames, taken from the UI objects
            in the interface editor; selecting objectName from popup will insert
            object name already formatted (i.e. selecting "amplitude" objectName
            will insert "<amplitude>")

    [updated] - Knob value display for blueSynthBuilder now limited to display
            7 characters (no ...'s)

    [updated] - when rendering, status bar shows messages of "Generating
            CSD...", "Rendering CSD...", and "Finished Rendering CSD"

    [fix] - typo in PMask file score.py, sent in by Francisco Vila

    [fix] - Blue did not parse tied notes correctly; blue tried to look for
            negative values on p2 instead of p3

[released 2004.08.11]

blue

    [new] - when creating new project, if "default.blue" file is in user's
            .blue directory, new project will use that as a default template
            instead of empty project file

    [new] - CeciliaModule - implemented GrapherMenuBar

    [new] - double-clicking PolyObjects in SoundObjectLibraryDialog now edits
        the PolyObject in the main score timeline editing area

    [new] - MainToolBar - replaced render/stop buttons with Play and Stop
        buttons that indicate mode rendering is in

    [updated] - logging messages removed from pythonObject SoundObject when
            generating score

    [fix] - cloned Instance soundObjects (copies) did not point to the same
            soundObject as the original Instance; caused file loading problems;
            fixed cloning to have new copies point to the same soundObject from
            the soundObjectLibrary

    [fix] - when clearing soundObject property dialog, notelists should clear
            too

    [fix] - GenericInstrument- values were allowed to be set as 'null' which
            would produce text 'null' when generating instrument

    [fix] - opcode popup and code completion should not be available on text
            areas that are not enabled for editing

    [fix] - added checks to ProjectOptions for null values when deserializing
            from XML

    [fix] - when compiling CSD from .blue using blue command-line options, blue
            did not check to see if .blue file was in older or newer file format

    [fix] - file reverting did not work with 0.94.0 project files

    [fix] - if blue exits, kills csound is rendering

internal

    [new] - refactored out MainToolBar class from BlueMainFrame

    [new] - created StatusBar class to be used statically for setting the status
            message on the main frame


>Notes for 0.94.0 beta 3b<
[released 2004.6.10]

blue

    [fix] - CeciliaModule - CSlider resolution was not be parsed and defaulted
            to 0.1; value was too low for some sliders, causing very large range
            values and was the source of slow GUI loading for modules

    [fix] - CeciliaModule - some CSlider values should be output as integers

    [fix] - CeciliaModule - rt-click now removes points to match Cecilia's
            behavior


>Notes for 0.94.0 beta 3a<
[released 2004.6.7]

blue

    [fix] - added repaint call when editing new CeciliaModule

    [fix] - graphs were using wrong colors due to not drawing in correct order

    [fix] - sound file names have all backslashes converted to slashes


>Notes for 0.94.0 beta 3<
[released 2004.6.6]

blue

    [new] - first time CeciliaModule enabled; mostly functional, use modules
            from lib/ceciliaModule (should start there when doing load module),
            still pieces left to implement!

    [fix] - polyObject needed to respect muting and soloing for generateTables,
            generateInstruments, and generateGlobals

    [fix] - if currentSoundObject is being edited, don't refocus in
            SoundObjectEditPanel; increased speed when moving/resizing
            soundObjects on timeline that take a long time to bring up
            editor for

    [fix] - Arrangement would always append a number when adding an instrument
            with name as id; should only do if id is already in arrangement


>Notes for 0.94.0 beta 2<
[released 2004.5.9]

blue

    [new] - Added ability to shift soundObjects by a given time amount
            (Select soundObjects on timeline, rt-click on any soundObject,
            choose "Shift", then enter time value to shift by)

    [new] - CommandBlocks - currently for use in globalOrc in Instruments, it
            allows for directions to be given to blue for what to do within the
            block; currently two commands are implemented, "pre" which moves the
            enclosed text to the top and "once" which will only use that text
            once even if other instruments define it too

    [new] - *File format changed* - all data now in valid XML format
                -Changes have occurred in all data classes for custom
                saving/loading to/from XML
                -File size generally smaller by 20%
                -Opens opportunities for cleaning up data classes and new
                features which require more flexible data saving

    [updated] - SoundObject Interface changed, added saveAsXML() and
            setNoteProcessorChain(), added loadFromXML as required static method
            (not expressable in Interface)

    [updated] - refactored PolyObject's addLayer to newSoundLayer, returns new
            SoundLayer (old way was to create a layer and add it to polyObject)

    [updated] - reworked InstrumentEditPanel to add tabs for Instrument Editor
            and to bring back Comments for instruments

    [fix] - Instruments generate globalOrc once even if assigned multiple times
            in Arrangement (globalSco still generates multiple times)

    [fix] - Instruments did not clone all properties (Global Orc and Sco)

    [fix] - using keyboard shortcuts in InstrumentLibrary before using popup
            menu at least once caused NullPointerException

>Notes for 0.94.0 beta 1<
[released 2004.4.5]

blue

    [new] - Orchestra Manager updated: instruments are now in a tree, to enable
            instruments, insert them into Arrangement (concept borrowed from
            Michael Gogins' program "Silence").  See documentation for usage.

    [new] - blue.orchstra.Instrument interface changed: added
            generateGlobalOrc() and generateGlobalSco()

    [update] - Instrument Conditionals have been deprecated and no longer
            work; not necessary due to instruments capable of generating
            global orc and sco

    [update] - modified Look and Feel: main blue color changed to lighter color,
            inverted table header border

    [update] - Spanish translation updated by Francisco Vila

    [update] - added link for linuxPPC JVM to installation instructions

            annoyance when not being able to make bottom pane smaller

internal

    [update] - removed method supportsNoteProcessors from SoundObject class,
            implicit from getNoteProcessors returning null


>Notes for 0.93.2a<
[released 2004.2.22]

blue

    [fix] - Instrument Conditionals were being operated on original BlueData
            instead of cloned copy, thus removing code from actual work
            document; was not viewable until reopening of file

>Notes for 0.93.2<
[released 2004.2.21]

blue

    [new] - Instrument Conditionals - Text in globals tab (orc and sco) and
            ftables in tables tab can be conditionally inserted into outputted
            CSD, depending on if an instrument has been enabled in Orchestra
            Manager; useful to optimize generated CSD to only have tables,
            notes, and instrument-0 code that is necessary (please read manual
            entry for more information, found under Users->User's Manual->
            Other Features->Instrument Conditionals)

    [new] - LineAdd and LineMultiply NoteProcessors

    [new] - added capacity to copy and paste soundObjects between Score area
            and blueLive dialog (will not allow pasting of soundObjects into
            the blueLive that are not enabled for use with blueLive)

    [new] - if project's commandline in project properties is empty, will use
            default commandline from Program Options to render the project
            when using [render/stop] or "Generate Score to Run"

    [update] - shortcut key for render/stop project changed to F9 from ctrl-~ to
            accomodate keyboards in other languages that don't have ~

    [update] - CsoundAV opcode definitions added to opcodes.xml; opcode info
            accessible from popup menu as well as code completion (ctrl-space
            while in text editor); syntax hilighting will hilight CsoundAV
            opcodes (opcode definitions contributed by Andres Cabrera)

    [fix] - Orchestra Manager now allows instrument number up to 9999 to be
            visible

    [fix] - Open as Instrument Library dialog did not allow copying of
            instrument into current working project

    [fix] - reworked calls to repaint ScoreTimeCanvas to improve speed

    [internal] - added pnuts.awt.PnutsLayout layout manager

blue

    [updated] - Import CSD now has multiple options for how to handle
            i-statements from CsScore, as well as will respect "s" section
            statement when importing

    [updated] - Documentation

            -extra notes on usage of timeWarpProcessor
            -extra note on noteProcessor main page regarding order of
                application
            -new documentation on Import from CSD
            -reorganized organization of documentation for User's Documentation
            -added commandlines to use with External SoundObject for use with
                CMask and nGen

    [fix] - bug with BlueSystem initialization did not correctly load selected
            language files; now loads correctly

    [fix] - clicking on timeline caused unneccessary function calls to
            getObjectiveDuration() on buffered soundObject which could cause
            noticable slowdown when working with a buffered soundObject that is
            heavy in script

    [fix] - calling polyObject.normalizeSoundObjects() had unnecessary call to
            getObjectiveDuration() which would cause all soundObjects to
            generate their scores and cause a noticable slowdown (occurred when
            pasting a polyObject after copying a group of soundObjects)

    [fix] - For soundObject freezing, on OSX, will use .aif files instead of
            .wav

    [fix] - copying soundObjects did not always maintain time behavior

>Notes for 0.93.0<

            added IzPack (http://www.izforge.com) installer.xml file to build
            GUI installer programs

    [new] - soundFont viewer dialog added to view instruments and presets for
            a soundfont; requires csound to be in the users PATH, uses sfilist
            and sfplist opcodes in csound to list what's available in soundfont

    [updated] - blueShare

                - loading message when hitting server on import pane
                - managment tab added for removing instruments user has
                  submitted

    [updated] - when editing soundObjects in blueLive dialog, green border now
            shows what soundObject is currently being edited

            the user manual entry for score timeline

    [updated] - changed BlueTheme
                - 5 pixel splitPane dividers, color
                - swapped colors on splitePane viewPort borders

    [updated/fix] - blue now calls csound from the directory the project file is
            located in (so all relative files used in the project work
            correctly)

    [fix] - "save file" and "file library" dialogs should now default correctly
            to the work directory set in user preferences

    [fix] - audioFile did not swap "\" with "/" as is required for windows
            file names

    [fix] - audioFile would give error if no soundFile selected, changed to
            only show alert if a selected file no longer is openable (moved,
            deleted, etc.)

    [internal] - extracted out blue.gui.FileTree from SoundFileManager as a
            reusable component

>Notes for 0.92.3<
[released 2003.10.1]

blue

    [new] - new blueLive dialog for performing SCO text in realtime

            blueLive mode of playing takes current work project and generates
            everything except for score blocks, automatically putting in
            f0 3600 and replacing <TOTAL_DUR> with 3600.

            -Rt-Clicking in the score area adds a soundObject
            -Double-clicking on the soundObject label edits the soundObject
            -Clicking on the soundObject label brings up its editor
            -clicking on the big button fires off the score if csound is
            currently playing (via stdin)

            (Documentation has been added to the User Manual within the
            in-program help, accessible by pressing F1)

    [updated] - AudioFile object now on by default

    [fix] - blue.command and other shells scripts were mistyped with "#/bin/sh"
            instead of "#!/bin/sh"

[released 2003.9.22]

blue

    [new] - new AudioFile soundObject makes it easy to add audio files into your
            project; select a soundFile from your drive and the editor will give
            you information about the soundFile as well as a place to add/modify
            the csoundCode (i.e. add some processing to your soundFile or change
            the output to zak-variables instead of the default out)

            *note: currently in beta and not guaranteed (though most likely) to
            load in future versions of blue; not enabled by default: to use,
            uncomment the commented line in blue/conf/registry.xml that refers
            to the AudioFile object

    [new] - added requirement that BLUE_HOME environment variable to be set;
            this has been done so within the blue starter scripts; consult

            GenericEditor(GenericScore, PythonObject, RhinoObject)

    [new] - added ability to open file from commandline by passing in file names
            i.e. blue someFile.blue anotherFile.blue  will start blue with those
            two files open

    [new] - changed all settings files to be moved to .blue directory in user
            home

            *if [userhome]/.blue is found not to exist, then .blue will be made

            *if [userhome]/.blue has to be made, it will make a copy of old
            .blueConfig.xml if found;

            *libraries for internal python objects (soundObject, instrument) can
            now be placed in blue/lib/pythonLib or [userhome]/.blue/pythonLib

            *if [userhome]/.blue/codeRepository.xml does not exist, copy from
            blue/lib/codeRepository/codeRepository.xml

    [updated] - adding instruments now will use first available number after the
            the currently selected instrument, or first available number if no
            instrument is selected

    [updated] - removed "instance count" from SoundObject Library Dialog

    [new] - changed recent files to hold last 8 instead of 4

    [new] - added commandline options for blue (usage info accesible from
            calling blue starter script with -h, i.e. "blue.sh -h"); added
            compile mode to convert .blue file to .csd from commandline (using
            -c infile, with option -o outfile (outfile defaults to infile name
            with .blue changed to .csd); useful for batch processing of .blue
            files into csd's

    [new] - tab width of BlueEditorPane set to 8 characters

    [new] - made new class NoteProcessorChainEditor to edit NoteProcessors; able

            follow the leader

    [update/fix] - changed painting code for TimeBar back to using a bufferred
            image, improved overall drawing when scrolling horizontally of score
            timeline, fixed code to update for zooms

    [fix] - ScoreUtility.getBaseTen() would not properly add if pch was given
            without decimal point (i.e. 8 instead of 8.00) (affected PchAdd and
            PchInversion noteProcessors)

    [fix] - on Score timeline, after pasting in a soundObject, selection marquee
            was being enabled; set flag to not do a select after pasting

            while in a text editor, if you have a partially filled out opcode,
            pressing ctrl-space will do a lookup of that partial word and return
            any opcodes that start with the partial name and show in a dialog
            box options to use; selecting an option will automatically replace
            the partially filled out word with the opcode signature (uses the
            same database of opcode signatures found in conf/opcodes.xml)

    [new] - undo capabilities added to Score editor for major edits:

            adding soundObjects

            -when clicking to resize, will focus soundObject for editing
            -when selecting soundObjects, will not allow move or resize unless
            already selected (to prevent accidental moves after clicks)

    [fix] - NoteProcessors were not properly showing editor when selected,
            possibly resulting in user editing different noteProcessor than
            expected

internal

    [new] - moved all score editor classes to package blue.score

>Notes for 0.91.5<
[released 2003.6.1]

    [new] - added support for "+" in p2 and "." in pfields in Csound score text
            (GenericScore)
    [new] - soundObjects now have time behavior property that will either

            "repeat"    - repeat notes up to subjective duration
            "none"      - do not appply any time operations

    [updated] - repetitionObject deprecated and no longer available due to
            new time operation options; all project files when opened will
            convert any found repetitionObjects into genericScore objects
            with "repeat" time behavior set
    [updated] - removed objective duration from soundObject properties
    [fix] - CSDUtility trims spaces of instruments names when importing from

    [new] - Catalan translation contributed
    [new] - added Help option from help menu, updated documentation
    [new] - Scratch Pad data now persistent (for making tutorial notes)
    [new] - TimeWarp noteProcessor - allows for time warping in the same way as
            Csound t-statements on a per-soundObject basis

    [update] - changed painting code for TimeBar to use a bufferred image,
            improved overall drawing when scrolling horizontally of score
            timeline (syntax is the same except no 't' is needed)
    [update] - removed bumps on ScrollBar's thumb

    [update/fix] - Note soundObject now removes "i" when parsing a note string
            and adds when generating note text (was interfering with Equals
            NoteProcessor and replacing p1)

    [fix] - fixed buggy behavior of pasting in soundObjects then dragging
    [fix] - array index out of bounds was being thrown when trying to paste
            a soundObject outside of the ScoreTimeCanvas
    [fix] - removing note processors when none were instantiated caused an
            exception
    [fix] - Repetition Object would go into an infinite loop and crash blue
            if no score was given and the object was called for score
            generation
    [fix] - when rendering, now will use quotes around filename if on Windows
            (previously, not doing so would cause problems with filenames that
            had spaces in them)
    [fix] - Orchestra updates when instruments are imported through blueShare
            (prior to fix, imports would occur but would not show until view
            was resized or otherwise changed)

internal

    [new] - OrchestraTableModel was passed into blueShare classes for updating,
            hack for now, should be later redone with proper MVC

[released 2003.2.25]

blue

    [new] - added SwitchProcessor NoteProcessor: switches pfield1 with pfield2
            for all notes in soundObject; useful in conjunction with
            RetrogradeProcessor when reversing notes that have start and end
            values in pfields, i.e.

            ;inum start dur   start   end
            i1    0     1     8.04    8.00
            i1    1     2     8.00    8.07

            with just retrograde processor becomes:

    [update] - changed close shortcut to "Ctrl-W" instead of "Ctrl-F4"
    [update] - changed text areas in blueShare to be word wrapped
    [update/fix] - changed hardcode use of CTRL key to platform dependent
            shortcut key(apple key on mac)

    [fix] - SoundObject property dialog was not properly displaying
            NoteProcessorChain list; flaky behavior exhibited (editting
            noteProcessor on one soundObject might actually be editting
            noteProcessor from other soundObject, etc.). This was all due to a
            bad index on the ListModel.

patterns

    [new] - add blueShare (accessible from Tools menu)
    [fix] - files would not save, only "save as"

internal

            this initial version, blueShare supports sharing instruments only.
            Future versions may support sharing other resources. Sharing is
            free, though to submit an instrument requires a username and
            password.

    [updated/fix] - CSD importing now preserves instrument numbers
    [updated] - changed render location of outputted temp CSD files when using
            [render/stop] button to directory where .blue file is located;
            change due to that if you wanted to group any dependent wav files or
            other files that csound normally would look to check for in the same
            directory as the csd file, this would fail, as temp CSD files were
            being generated to the system's temp directory
    [updated] - "play/stop" button renamed to "render/stop" button
    [updated] - soundFile browser now shows files with .aif ending (in addition

            to refresh the current directories listing
    [fix] - calculation of duration incorrect for instance soundObject,
            genericScore soundObject, and polyObject when using a noteProcessor
            that would change the number of notes generated (i.e. subList
            processor)

blue

    [new] - implemented preliminary snap; currently is dependent on pixel time
            shown, so will round to pixel's time representation
    [new] - added new noteProcessor EqualsProcessor; sets user-given pField of
            all notes in soundObject to user-given value, i.e. set all p4's to

            removed from tree

patterns

    [updated] - added help button for calling user-defined help command, works

    [fix] - fixed pushing up and down of layers

>Notes for 0.90.5<

    [new] - added drive selection in soundFile browser
    [new] - added logging message for pythonObject when generating notes; useful
            for finding out what pythonObject was the last one trying to
            generate notes if the pythonInterpreter happens to be unable to
            execute your script (for debugging)
    [new] - added new Rhino soundObject, a javaScript interpreter object;
            functionally identical to pythonObject except uses JavaScript;
            called rhinoObject because the Java Javascript Interpreter is called
            Rhino (http://www.mozilla.org/rhino)
    [new] - added scripting menu for reinitializing Jython interpreter or
            opening interactive prompt, as well as reinitializing Rhino
            Javascript interpreter
    [new] - added pythonInstrument for scripting instruments; works in similar
            fashion to python soundObject except uses 'instrument' variable to
            bring back into blue
    [new] - added rhinoInstrument for scripting instruments; works in similar
            fashion to rhino soundObject except uses 'instrument' variable to
            bring back into blue
    [new] - added error message to External SoundObject if the commandline given
            is unable to be executed
    [new] - added new CodeRepository editor dialog, aceesible from Tools menu;
            edits what used to be conf/custom.xml
            (now moved to lib/codeRepository/codeRepository.xml; if you're
            upgrading, copy over this file with your old custom.xml and rename),
            which is what shows up on the popup menu under the "custom" menu
            option
    [updated] - continuing changes of look and feel: changed tabs, worked with
            borders, etc.
    [updated] - changed look of external soundObject's bar renderer to not use
            gradients
    [updated] - created new blue.scripting package, moved PythonProxy class to
            there and rearchitected as static object
    [updated] - changed OpcodePopup class to static class with reinitialization
            functions so as to work with code repository
    [updated] - redid BlueSystem object, removed isInitialized() and used
            static {} block to do initializaiton
    [updated] - reimplemented Instrument interface; uses Editors like
            soundObjects; InstrumentEditPanel caches editors in the same way as
            SoundObjectEditPanel, which saves memory and speeds up editting of
            instruments; new Instrument interface should make it easier to
            create instrument plugins
    [updated] - added AlphabeticalFileComparator to sort files in the soundFile
            browser in alphabetical order
    [updated] - soundFile browser now uses double-clicks to initiate selection
            rather than single click
    [updated] - changed default text of python soundObject and rhinoSoundObject
            to have a demonstration note
    [updated] - redid ScoreGUI's scrolling: implemented Scrollable on
            ScoreTimeCanvas, blue.gui.JScrollerBar class to allow to swap out
            JScrollBar's from JScrollPane which tie into Scrollable objects
    [updated] - removed blue.gui.BlueButton class and made all classes use
            JButton (remnant from my earliest look and feel experiments)
    [updated/fix] - changed ScoreTimeCanvas to use BLIT_SCROLL_MODE; provides
            faster response and drawing, fixes bug of not clearing out the
            backing store when closing out a file (ghost image of old work file)
    [fix] - when calling "Convert to generic score" on a sound soundObject,
            instrument would be added to orchestra but not displayed until the
            orchestra split pane was resized; now updates correctly
    [fix] - making copies of a pythonObject did not copy its note processor
            chain; fixed clone() method in pythonObject
    [fix] - converting to genericScore would not properly grab notes from
            original soundObject, rescaling and translating the notes;
    [fix] - when zooming the scoreTimeCanvas, canvas would not resize properly
            horizontally; fixed logic in checkSize() method
    [fix] - overrided paintChildren() method in ScoreTimeCanvas to get Marquee
            drawing on top of children

>Notes for 0.90.4<

    [new] - added marquee selection (currently draws underneath soundObjects,
            will change later)
    [new] - added solo option to soundLayers, selecting solo only generates
            notes for that soundLayer in the polyObject; can be used in any
            polyObject
    [new] - partially implemented undo system; undo queues managed per tab,
            currently implemented for global, tables, and project properties;
            currently the text control's hilighting is interfering with the undo
            system causing multiple undo's necessary per inserted character;
            still more work to do...
    [updated] - now maintaining vertical scroll when after editting a polyObject
            and moving back up the polyObject tree
    [updated] - changed look of splitter for splitPanes
    [updated] - changed time bar to show time every 10 seconds when at lower
            resolution
    [updated/fix] - blue.utility.ScoreUtilities would die on parsing note text
            that wasn't a note but started with "i"; made Note() constructor
            private add Note.createNote() function to use as a factory method;
            now correctly removes any line of text that isn't a note
    [fix] - external soundObject would cause blue to hang java 1.4.1 jvm;
            removed process.waitFor() in code, using just buffer reading to
            determine end of program call
    [fix] - code in soundLayer resizing of height caused scoreTimeCanvas not to
            resize properly and would allow scrolling past canvas size
    [fix] - scrolling of main scoreTimeCanvas would revert to last buffer of
            image; resolved by turning doubleBuffering off on scrollPane
    [fix] - heightIndex was not properly being set in TimePixelManager, causing
            layer heights saved in polyObjects not to be displayed

>Notes for 0.90.3<

    [new] - add option for default kr, sr, nchnls, author, and commandline in
            program options dialog (found under file menu); new files will
            automatically have their values set to the defaults
    [new] - added GNU Public License to About dialog
    [new] - added menuoption to popup to 'set subjective time to objective time'
            for genericScore soundObjects
    [new] - added menuoption to popup for 'follow the leader', if more than one
            soundObject is selected, clicking 'follow the leader' will put the
            soundObjects one right after the other, in order of selection
    [new] - added Quick Time Dialog; when using score timeline, select a
            soundObject and press "ctrl-t" to pop open dialog to set start and
            subjective duration of soundObject; when openned, it will start with
            focus in start time and you can tab between the two fields; press
            enter to commit the change, escape or click anywhere besides the
            dialog to close it without making changes
    [updated/fix] - reimplemented blue.soundObject.Note class; processing of
            scores that use quotes (i.e. for filenames) properly maintain spaces
            inside the quotes (i.e. "my audio file.wav" comes out as "my audio
            file.wav")
    [updated] - split readme into readme and changelog, changed 'copying' file
            to license file
    [updated] - external SoundObject: for commandline, now have option to state
            '$infile' in commandLine where it will be replaced with the name of
            the temp file created for the text;

            example: if you have a commmandLine of "perl" it'll get changed to
            "perl tempFile.txt", while if you had something like "myProgram
            $infile arg1 arg2" it'll get changed to "myProgram tempFile.txt arg1
            arg2"


>Notes for 0.90.2<

    [new] - added Tools menu - runs user-defined commands, edit from
            Tools->Manage Tools, name is name on menu, commandline is command to
            run
    [updated] - soundFileManager - soundFile information more cleanly displayed,
            gen 01 table auto generated
    [updated] - cleaned up look of programOptions dialog
    [updated] - reworked BlueMainFrame; program now supports multiple documents
            open at the same time
    [fix] - TablesGUI, GlobalGUI, OrchestraGUI not setting data correctly when
            opening new files

>Notes for 0.90.1<

    [updated] - removed stack trace on process console to account for different
            behaviour of java 1.4.1 JVM
    [updated] - changed zoom icons from magnifying glasses to "+" and "-" for
            usability on ScoreGUI (score timeline)
    [updated/fix] - PolyObjectEditor clears out display of soundObjects when
            selecting a different polyObject
    [fix] - ftable edittor properly clears tables when new blue file is openned
    [updated] - changed colors and look of time bar
    [updated] - added missing icons for dialogs (Question.gif, etc.)
    [updated/fix] - changed behaviour of orchestra manager; new instruments are
            numbered to the first available space rather than at end of the list
    [updated] - changed behaviour of ProgramOptions class; now looks for
            .blueConfig.xml in user home directory by default if blue is not
            passed a configuration filename as a parameter, looks for
            .bluePatternsConfig.xml in user home directory for patterns; shell
            scripts and batch files were modified to reflect that change
    [fix] - edittor now automatically scrolls to top when editting a new
            soundObject
    [updated] - soundObject Property Dialog displays noteProcessor not supported
            message when editting soundObjects not supporting noteProcessors
    [new] - added initial soundFileManager - able to traverse filesystem and
            play soundfiles

>Notes for 0.90.0<

    *a sound object test file (soundObjectTest_0.90.0.blue) has been
        included in the work directory

    [new] - implemented syntax hilighting - required new BlueEditorPane and
        BlueSyntaxDocument classes

    opcodes are hilighted in bold orange
    csound variables (words starting with i, k, a, gi, gk, ga) are in pink
    comments are in gray
    quotes are in pink

    [new] - External SoundObject - text inside edittor is written to a temp
                file and command line given is run on the temp file, anything
                written to stdout is brought back into blue

            (so you can run perl scripts, python, a commandline score
                generator like mother, etc.)

    [new] - Repetition SoundObject - accepts standard csound score, repeats
                score depending on duration

            if your score text has two notes, "i1 0 1" and "i1 1 1", and
                your subjective duration is 4.5, the repetition object will
                repeat your score twice, then stop as it can't fit any more of
                the original score in; with the same score, if you set the
                subjective duration to 5.5, the repetition soundObject would
                repeat your score twice, then add the first note, but not the
                second.

    [new] - added a test button for soundObjects that implement
                GenericEdittable; clicking on the test button pops up a dialog
                and shows what the notes from the soundObject will be when
                generated. useful for testing python scripts from the python
                soundObject, or seeing testing the affects of applied
                noteProcessors
    [new] - added a utility InfoDialog class to blue.gui package; used by
                GenericEdittor to show outputted notes
    [new] - converting a soundObject into a generic score will call
                generateInstruments and append instruments to orchestra
    [updated] - changed color of comment object to darkGray
    [updated] - updated jython to 2.1 release (was using older 2.0)
    [updated] - changed default for new instruments in orchestra manager
                to be set to enabled
    [updated] - removed DurationsSequence soundObject
    [fix] - making copies of GenericScore did not copy their noteProcessors

>Notes for 0.89.6.1<

        [FIX] - serious bug with upgrade code introduced in 0.89.5; load of
                files would clear tables and globals;


>Notes for 0.89.6<

        >blue<
    [fix] - selecting "convert to generic score" from score timeline when no
                objects selected caused null pointer error

        >patterns<
    [fix] - muting of tracks now working
        [fix] - title of frame now being set correctly to "blue - patterns"
    [updated] - release version numbers synchronized to blue

>Notes for 0.89.5<
    [new] - support for tied notes (negative start times) in Note class
    [new/updated] - refactored to componentize subparts of blue (orchestra
                editor, global editor, projectPropertiesEditor) which opens
                options for reuse to quickly build new composition environments
                (may do polyObject editor in the future, but not necessary
                subpart)

    [new] - new Pattern based music program, "Patterns" created

    Patterns is a pattern-oriented music program.  Patterns was able to be
        made quickly by using the blue core libraries.  It features a grid
        edittor and a bank of patterns.  Patterns may be of arbitrary metrical
        breakdown, meaning it's simple to have a pattern broken into 3 part over
        a pattern broken into 5 parts, etc.  More documentation to follow.
        Please open testPatterns.patterns, located in the work directory, to see
        how Patterns operates.  More documentation to follow.

>Notes for 0.89.4<
    [new] - <TOTAL_DUR> variable added for globalScore; anywhere where
                <TOTAL_DUR> is found in the global score section, it will get
                replaced with the calculated duration of the generated notes
                from the timeline; i.e. useful for global reverbs where you'd
                like the reverb to always last the total duration of all the
                notes + 3 seconds, etc.
    [new] - helpButton added, runs user-defined help command; defined in
                program options, under File menu
    [new] - zoom of timeline for a polyObject now maintained between
                sessions(PolyObject, TimePixelManager and PolyObjectBar
                modified)
    [new] - External SoundObject - runs external program and captures
                output, has temporary textArea
    [new/fix] - added CSDRunner class to encapsulate ProcessConsole,
                correctly destroys self after process finishes
    [new/updated] - made play button into play/stop button; if csound is
                currently running, pressing the button will stop performance
    [fix] - editted ProcessConsole class to properly kill threads (had been
                taking up to 90% of cpu after process finished)
    [fix] - adding noteProcessors did not clone new noteProcessors


>Notes for 0.89.3<
    [new] - Regrograde Processor - Note processor reverses order of notes,
                using:

            newStartTime = totalDurationOfNoteList -
                                (noteOldStartTime + noteDuration)

    [fix] - not working with Java 1.4 JVM - Removed TypeAheadSelector,
                added error checks to NoteListModel

>Notes for 0.89.2<
    [new] - Pch Add Processor - Note processor that allows you to add and
                subtract from pfields that are for use with cpspch, so you can
                say -11 or 5 to transpose notes; i.e. a note with 5.01 and a -3
                value to the processor would yield 4.10; does not support
                fractional pch (i.e. 8.055, 4.112)
    [fix] - soundObjects in instances from soundObjectLibrary were not
                copied by reference; improper behaviour of instances (changing
                value of object in library did not change what the instances
                generated from)
    [fix] - ctrl-mouseDown to paste would give nullPointer exception if
                nothing was in buffer; error handling added

>Notes for 0.89.1<

    [bugfix] - adding instruments to orchestra did not properly clone for
                new instruments


>Notes for 0.89.0<

i've been working with this one for the past week and just didn't spend the time
to package up for release.  i'm finding less usability issues for myself, so if
you're finding things, please email me.

lots of reworking.  the way layers have been handled has been completely redone.
you can now push up/down layers, remove multiple at a time, and also insert a
new layer wherever.  also lots of shortcuts add have sped up timeline use (at
least, it did for me).  you can ctrl-x/ctrl-c to cut or copy and then ctrl-click
to paste.


    [new] - moved all configuration xml files to conf directory
    [new] - moved rendering option out from BlueData class, now
                renderer classes from blue.render
    [new/updated] - reworked working with SoundLayers (layers on timeline);
                can now select multiple layers, push them up, push them down,
                remove multiple; can add a layer anywhere (used to only be able
                to add layers to the end); implemented in new
                blue.SoundLayerEditPanel (ScoreTimeInfoPanel and
                SoundLayerInfoPanel were removed)
    [new] - cut, copy selected soundObjects with ctrl-x, ctrl-c; paste by
                holding ctrl and clicking on timeline; remove selected
                soundObject with delete key
    [new] - Program Options Dialog - can set up default work directory from
                here
    [updated] - blue.ScoreGUI reworked to allow resizing between layer
                information and timeline area
    [updated/fix] - note processors can be pushed up and down in chain; note
                processor list and property editor properly updates itself
    [updated] - word wrap option added to scratch pad dialog
    [fix] - recent files were not properly being saved
    [fix] - Instances made from the soundObjectLibrary were not properly
                generating durations for notes
    [updated] - can't move splitpane of timeline all the way down, but can
                collapse splitpane

still need to do documentation, other soundObjects.  i'm trying to figure out a
roadmap to version 1.0 for myself, to keep myself focused when i'm programming.
i've also been spending more time composing, so fixes and additions will
probably as it has been, here and there.

enjoy,
steven

>Notes for 0.88.0<

what a joy it is for myself to see blue evolving!  such a satisfaction from
creating one's own tool for composition.

i cleaned up alot of stuff internally, making it alot easier for myself and
whoever may wish to add to blue to add soundObjects, instruments, and
noteProcessors.  i just had the idea to add utility dialogs to the registry as
well, but that'll be in the next release. as always, if you have any issues,
comments, criticism, etc. please let me know.  also, there's an egroups mailing
list for blue that i've set up for discussion on blue.  as i've gotten very l
ittle regular feedback on blue, i'll continue to work off my own needs and wants
for the program.  but if you're interested in seeing things in blue, feel free
to make requests on the mailing list or email me directly anytime.

here's the rundown:

    [new] - CommentObject - add comments in the timeline
    [new] - ScratchPad Dialog - a blank text dialog for whatever happens to
                be on your mindaccessible from Window menu, or press F5
                (NOTE: does not get saved)
    [new] - AbstractSoundObject - convenience class for implemented
                SoundObjects
    [new] - implemented GenericEditor and GenericEditable to ease
                soundObject creation
    [new] - implemented BlueSystem object - allows for cleaner
                implementation of system properties, which in turn makes it
                easier for developers to have objects interact with blue
    [new] - registry.xml - soundObjects, instruments, and noteProcessors
                dynamically loaded(instruments in this case are
                blue.orchestra.Instrument's, not csound instruments)
    [new] - implemented SoundObjectEditPanel to cache editors, changed
                interface of soundObjects to accomodate:optimization for
                performance
    [new] - migrated setting files to conf dir
    [updated] - Colors - back to blue theme (still working on getting it
                right!)
    [updated] - PolyObjectBarRenderer - started playing the bar renderers,
                to better differentiate where PolyObjects are
    [fix] - added JScrollPane for ProjectPropertiesGUI's note text
    [fix] - if a soundLayer is muted, instruments now not generated from
                soundObjects that generate instruments
    [fix] - fixed flickering on polyObject timeLine[bug] - can't move
                splitpane of timeline all the way down

i've been lazy about documentation, i know! but the framework of blue is really
getting to the point where i don't have to think about it so much now, so my
work on blue will be shifting from internal construction outwards to
documentation and adding soundObjects (apologies to Gabriel Maldonado for being
slow to implement the PianoRoll!).

so much more to add as well... but it's getting there.

^_^

enjoy!
-steven

>Notes for 0.87.0<

lots of false starts... things i tried but abandoned.  oh well.  here's the
run-down:

[end user]
    - fixed scroll bug
    - began work on color scheme
        - added soundObject library, Instance object (press F4 to open, or
          select from "Windows" menu).  rt-click on an object on a timeline to
          add to the library.  later, if you want to make an instance of the
          soundObject from the library, go to the library dialog, select the one
          you want, press the copy button, and then rt-click on the main
          timeline and select paste.  you should get an Instance of the
          soundObject there.  try using with noteProcessors (see note below)
    - moved all project information into properties tab
    - colors changed
    - noteProcessors, addable to most soundObjects; access these from the soundObject Property dialog (F3 when the main program is focused, or select from "Windows" menu) allows for things like "adding 1.3 to every p4 field" or "use only notes 4-8". good in conjunction with soundObject Instances from soundLibrary (i.e. i have a motif in the library, i have four instances of it, one which is transposed up, one transposed down, and two more which are only fragments of the motif)

[internal]
    - changed from using generateScore() to generateNotes() (producing Notelist's instead of String's)
    - pushed out class MotionBuffer from SoundObjectBuffer
    - created blue.components package, for reusable components
    - add blue.soundObject.renderer (renders bar on ScoreTimeline)
    - moved all Utility classes to blue.utilities
    - created blue.render package

[started]
    - ftable manager, reconsidering using live edittor (roundtrip)
    - piano roll
    - note table edittor
    - LStdinPlayer
    - scsort() function

this release is a bit 'dirty' in that i'm not quite sure if i tested everything.
i actually got a bit lost at one point because i tried to add too many things at
once and just got confused.  anyways, i think that lots of functionality got
added, so hopefully it'll all work out.

i also want to spend some time doing new documentation.
any requests for information?

later!
steven

>Notes for 0.86.5<

what i added:

    -shift-click to select multiple soundobjects
        -cut, copy, and paste multiple soundobjects (currently pasted as
                a new polyObject if multiple soundobjects selected)
    -converting a soundObject to generic score
    -converting a soundObject or multiple soundObjects into a polyObject
    -double-clicking enters into a timeline of a polyObject
    -added a "globals" tab, move the global orchestra stuff to here, added
                global score stuff.  (one could, theoretically, not even use the
                time line now and just code away in the global score area)

    -the Patterns preprocessor: preprocessor for pattern based music.  the
        format is as following: in a csd file, add patterns within pattern tags.
        within the score, add p-statements with two p-fields: patternName and
        startTime.

a lame example:

    <CsoundSynthesizer>
    ...
    <Patterns>

    pattern 1 ; drums
        i1 0 1 3 40
        i1 1 1 3 40
    endpattern

    pattern 2 ; bass drums
        i1 0 1 3 40
        i1 1 1 3 40
        i1 2 1 3 40
        i1 3 1 3 40
    endpattern

    pattern trumpetLine ; yes, you can use names as well
        i2 0 2 5
        i2 .5 2 5
    endpattern

    pattern set1 ; here i'm embedding patterns within the pattern
        p1 0
        p2 0
        p trumpetLine 0
        ptrumpetLine 2 ; can have a space or not, like i-statements
        i4 3 0 0
    endpattern

    </patterns>

    <CsScore>
        i1 0 4 0
        p1 0
        p1 4
        p1 8
        p2 0
        p2 4
        p2 8
        p trumpetLine 0
        p trumpetLine 8
        p set1 2

    </CsScore>
    <CsoundSynthesizer>


    all of the p-statements would get expanded out, such that, in the above
        example, if you had "p2 4", the resulting score generated would be:

        i1 4 1 3 40
        i1 5 1 3 40
        i1 6 1 3 40
        i1 7 1 3 40

    (it's a pretty simple system; i built it in a few hours and need to add
        some more error-checking code, but for it works fine right now)

what's not quite implemented:
    -enabling/disabling instrument generation : good for .blue files with a
        a very large amount of instruments.  that way, you could keep one
        massive library of instruments, then only generate the ones you wanted
        to the resulting .csd file, which would cut down on sound generation
        time.  you'll see a new column on the orchestra editting area, but it
        doesn't do anything yet.
    -adding GNU style options for the commandline of blue.  i want add
        possibilities like "blue --patterns inFile.csd outFile.csd" or
        "blue --compile in.blue out.csd".  that'll be in soon.

this release is more for me to get myself going than anything polished.  i've
been using this version myself and it seems to work fine for me.  also, it's the
first source code release, which is also for myself to get going more than
anything.  it's a bit ugly in there... if you're looking to hack at it, please
do contact me and i'd love to coordinate changes and features.

please send any comments and bug reports to kunstmusik@hotmail.com

enjoy!

steven


[CHANGE LOG]

-added 'open as library' option
-internal refactoring of code

[0.8] - 2001.6.10

-added option to generate csd files from a start time

[0.79.7] - 2001.5.21

-added "sound" soundObject
-added track muting
-added soundObject dragging between soundLayers
-enabled tooltips for soundObjects

[0.79.1] - 2001.5.1

-bug fix for start times

[0.79] - 2001.4.30

-I made lots of changes... I'll write more details when I put out ver 0.8
(hopefully) later this week

[0.71] - 2001.3.7

-ability to name soundObjects implemented
-moved soundObject properties bar into a floating palette
-cleaned up the look quite a bit!  will continue with this as always

[0.7] - 2001.3.2

-added a timebar up top
-added layer names
-added get/set names to all soundObjects (not yet edittable though)
-moved "add layer" from popup to remaining in window
-added "Generate CSD and Run" option
    -what this does is takes the commandLine parameter from Project Options
        and uses that to run a temporary csd file that is generated
    -if "csound" is the commanLine parameter, it would be as if you ran
        "csound tempCsd1352.csd"
    -the temp file is automatically deleted after the JVM closes, so you
         don't need to worry about it

[0.67] - 2001.2.26

-reworked some internals
    -add Note class (still needs work)
-added default ".oce" and ".csd" endings for save and generate options
-save and generate options now default to current working directory
-started changes to look and feel (this is not a priority right now, as I still
feel I need to work the program's structure more importantly than the look; but
it was a bit too unsightly, so I did some basic changes)

[0.65]

-added cut, copy, paste of soundObjects
-added prevention of moving blocks to negative start times
-added dialog options for sr, kr, nchnls (ksmps calculated from sr/kr)
