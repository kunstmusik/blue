    <para>
      The Score is the tool in blue for working with musical material in time.
      It is a canvas upon which to create and organize musical ideas. The Score
      features a modular timeline, where each 
      <link linkend="layerGroups">Layer Group</link> within the Score is a
      module.  These modules are a plug-in point that can be extended with other
      plug-ins.  Each Layer Group in turn may be broken down into layers.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The image above shows a Score with three Layer Groups.  The first two are
      Patterns LayerGroups, while the last is a SoundObject Layer Group. Also 
      shown is the ScoreManager dialog (accessible from the Manage button on the
      left part of the Score).

      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <para>
        A Score is divided into Layer Groups. Each Layer Group has a 
        user-interface for the main timeline area, as well as a header interface
        that shows on the left-hand side.  The header area usually shows 
        meta-information and controls for each of the Layer Group's layers, such
        as layer name, muting, soloing, and other features.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        By using the Score Manager Dialog, you can add as many Layer Groups as
        you like, as well as many layers to each group as you like. You can also
        push up and down Layer Groups to reorganize them.  The same 
        add/remove/push up/push down actions are also available for Layers 
        within a Layer Group. 
      </para>
      
      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <para>
          Add/Remove/Push Up/Push Down for layers is also available while 
          working in the main score area by right-clicking the Layer panels
          on the right and selecting the options from the popup menu.
        </para>
      </note>
      
      <para>Also, all LayerGroups support having 
        <link linkend="noteProcessors">NoteProcessors</link> used with them.
        Using a NoteProcessor on a LayerGroup will affect all notes generated
        within that LayerGroup.  Editing the LayerGroup's NoteProcessors can
        be done by right clicking on the root Score node in the 
        <link linkend="scoreBar">Score Bar</link>, described below.
      </para>
      
      <para>  
        Regarding the design, a Layer Group is primarily responsible for 
        generating Csound Score notes. However, they are also able to generate
        tables, instruments, and anything else that is usable in Csound.  It is
        up to the developer to choose what features the Layer Group will use.
      </para>
    </simplesect>
    
    <simplesect>
      <title>SoundObject</title>
      
      <para>
        SoundObject Layer Groups are one of the primary Layer Group types. They
        support the SoundObject system in blue for scoring them in time on the
        timeline. They also are the canvas on which 
        <link linkend="parameterAutomation">automations</link> are drawn.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        SoundObject Layer Groups are divided into SoundLayers. Each SoundLayer
        can contain SoundObjects of any type as well as have automations 
        assigned to the layer.  Unlike MIDI-based studio software, where layers
        are bound to a single instrument or channel in a mixer, blue's 
        SoundLayers are free to hold SoundObjects that generate any data for any
        instrument. This design choice allows freedoms for you to design your
        project as you wish, though at the expense of being able to implement 
        some things which may be commonly found in MIDI-based studio software.
      </para>
      
      <para>To use the SoundObject system, first create a SoundObject Layer 
        Group using the Score Manager Dialog. (By default, new projects in blue
        start with a single SoundObject Layer Group.) Next, add as many layers
        as you would like to the LayerGroup.  You can then edit the names of the
        layers using the ScoreManager Dialog, or back in the main Score area by
        double-clicking the area on the left of the Layer's panel on the left.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        On the timeline, rt-clicking on any soundLayer will show menu options 
        for adding different types of SoundObjects, pasting a SoundObject from the
        buffer if any SoundObjects in the buffer are available, as well as other
        commands. (Copying and pasting of SoundObjects can also be done using
        ctrl-c and ctrl-click on a layer.)
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have SoundObjects on the timeline, you can click on them to
        select it, or click in an empty area and drag to show a selection 
        rectangle. You can also add and remove SoundObjects to/from the 
        selectionn by holding shift when clicking.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Once selected, you can move selected SoundObjects by pressing the mouse down
        on one of the selected SoundObjects, then drag to move them in time as 
        well as up and down layers.  If you press shift down when you click, 
        once you drag you will create clones of the original material and move
        them in time. If you move the mouse to the right-side of a SoundObject,
        the cursor will change to a resize cursor, and clicking and dragging 
        will allow you to change the duration of the SoundObject. (Note you can
        only resize one SoundObject at a time.)
      </para>

      <para>
        If you have a single SoundObject selected, you can edit the properties 
        of the
        SoundObject by using the SoundObject Property Window. This window can be
        opened from the menu "Windows -&gt; Sound Object Properties" or by
        using the shortcut "F3". From this window you can change the name of the
        SoundObject, its start time and subjective duration, as well as add and
        remove NoteProcessors (if the SoundObject supports it).
      </para>


      <para>
        To edit a SoundObject, select a single SoundObject and open the 
        SoundObject Editor window.  You can also double-click a SoundObject, 
        which will set the editor for the SoundObject in the Editor window as 
        well as focus the SoundObject Editor window. (If the Editor window is
        docked, double-clicking the SoundObject will cause the editor to show
        the docked window.)
      </para>
      
      <!-- <para>
        Rt-clicking on a soundObject pops open a menu (shown in the picture above)
        which will let you add a soundObject to the soundObject library(only the
        one clicked on), convert soundObjects into a polyObject(any selected
        soundObjects), convert a soundObject into a genericScore soundObject, or
        cut/paste/remove. Converting to a polyObject is useful if you're editting
        on a time line and decide you'd like to group the soundObjects together to
        handle them as a single soundObject. Converting to a genericScore is
        useful if you're working with a soundObject that isn't a genericScore and
        want to start editting it as a genericScore.

    <simplesect>
      <title>Patterns</title>
      
      <para>Patterns Layer Groups are based upon the same SoundObject system
        as the SoundObject Layer Groups, but presents a different way to working
        with these objects. At a high-level, each Pattern layer has one 
        SoundObject assigned to it. The SoundObject is the source score material
        for a Pattern Layer.  Selecting boxes in the grid that shows for the 
        Patter Layer determines where that score material will be used to 
        generate notes. For music projects that rely on patterns and regular
        metered time, using the Pattern Layer Groups can be more efficient for 
        creating a piece than using SoundObject Layer Groups. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The grid of time for Pattern Layers is currently hardcoded to repeat 
        every four beats, or one measure at 4/4 time.  However, a SoundObject
        is not constrained to generate score for only one measure.  For example,
        you can create a PianoRoll that has a time behavior of "None", and have
        it last sixteen beats (four measures). Everywhere that the pattern grid
        is selected for the Pattern Layer that uses that SoundObject will then
        create that sixteen beat score and start it at the time of the grid box.
      </para>

      <para>By default, new Pattern Layers will use a GenericScore SoundObject
      that is set to a duration of four beats, and use a time behavior of
      "None".  This means that the score will generate "as-is". In the layer's
      popup menu options, you can replace the SoundObject that is being used for 
      the layer with one from the SoundObject buffer (i.e. copied from blueLive
      or from a SoundObject Layer).  Also, you can switch to a different type
      of SoundObject using the menu. </para>
      
      <para>SoundObjects will generate accordingly to the values set in the 
        SoundObject Properties dialog, with the exception of the start time. 
        Blue will reassign the start time to 0 when it generates the notes for
        the layer. On the whole this behavior will not affect most users, but
        is worth noting.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To edit the SoundObject for a Pattern Layer, you can either use the 
        popup menu option for "Edit SoundObject", or you can also click the 
        layer panel on the left.  A single click will bring up the SoundObject
        editor.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To edit the layer's patterns, click on a grid box to toggle between 
        on and off for that box.  You can also press down and drag along to set
        multiple boxes.  The value that is set for the multiple boxes will 
        depend on the action of the first box selected.  For example, if the 
        first box when the initial mouse down is on, the mouse down will turn it
        off, and dragging will turn off all boxes that the mouse extends 
        through.

    <para>
      The tempo editor is an optional use feature that allows editing of 
      overall tempo for a project using a line editor. This feature starts off
      as disabled and closed.  When in this state, whatever tempo values are 
      saved will show as dark gray line that is uneditable.  To enable the use
      of the tempo editor, select the checkbox marked "Use Tempo".  Selecting 
      this will redraw the tempo line in green.  To open up the
      tempo editor for a larger view and for editing, select the down arrow 
      button next to the "Use Tempo" checkbox.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Like other line editor objects in blue, left-clicking on an area where
      there is no point will insert a new point, while hovering over an existing
      point and pressing down, then dragging will allow moving of that point. 
      Right-clicking a point will delete a point.
    </para>
    
    <para>If right-clicking the tempo editor when not on a point, the following
      popup menu will appear:

      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
  
    <para>
      The first option will allow editing of the values of the points entered
      into the line editor by use of a table with two columns: the first column
      being the beat on which the tempo change occurs and the right column being
      the tempo value that it should have. One may find using the table editor 
      easier to use to fine-tune values.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The second option will allow changing the boundary min and max tempo 
      values for the line editor, as well as the option for what to do for points
      that fall outside of the new range.  The options here are "Truncate" which
      will set any points' values that lie outside the new range to the closest
      boundary value, or "Scale" which will take all point values from the old
      range and scale them to the new range.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Use of the tempo editor is completely optional and users familiar with 
      Csound's t-statement for controlling global tempo may opt to disable using
      blue's tempo editor and to use a t-statement in the global orc section of
      the globals tab. Also, older blue projects that existed from before
      blue's tempo editor was developed can count on their projects loading 
      and running correctly even if opened with versions of blue that do have 
      a tempo editor, due to blue's default to disable the blue tempo editor.
      Regardless of which tempo system is chosen by the user, one should be
      careful not to use both at the same time as this will cause two 
      t-statements to exist in the generated CSD (the hand-entered one and the
      one generated by blue), causing unexpected performance results.

      In the upper right of the Score window is an arrow button; pressing this
