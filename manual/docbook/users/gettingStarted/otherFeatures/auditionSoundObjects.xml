    You are able to quickly audition individual SoundObjects or groups of
    SoundObjects on the timeline. This can be very useful to test out single
    SoundObject ideas or see how a few different SoundObjects sound together
    without having to mute/solo different SoundLayers. To use this feature,
    select desired SoundObjects for testing, right-click on a selected
    SoundObject, and from the SoundObject popup menu, choose "Audition
    SoundObjects". To stop auditioning, click anywhere on the score timeline.
    You may also initiate the audition by using the ctrl-shift-a shortcut or
    from the Project menu.
