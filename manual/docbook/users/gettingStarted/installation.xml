      Blue requires a Java 8 (also known as 1.8) or greater JVM (Java Virtual 
      Machine) to be installed on your system, as well as Csound. Java 
      installations usually come in two flavors: a JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
      which contains just a JVM for running applications, and a JDK (Java Development
      Kit) which contains the JVM as well as development tools. Because Blue 
      comes with scripting tools that use JDK features, it is recommended to 
      install the full JDK, and not just the JRE.

      lines of "command not found" then you need to install a Java Virtual 
      Machine.

      On this page, look for the download link for Java SE and choose the JDK
      download for your platform. Be sure to choose the version of JDK that 
      matches your CPU type and Csound version (choose 64-bit if in doubt).

    <para>
      Blue also works with OpenJDK versions of Java. These are pure open-source
      versions of Java that are often available through package managers on Linux.
      If you do use an OpenJDK version of Java, be sure to install JavaFX, a UI
      toolkit for Java that is often packaged separately from the main OpenJDK
      package.  (Installing the Oracle JDK will include JavaFX automatically.)

      To install Blue, you should download the latest ZIP file or DMG from
      the Blue releases page
      <ulink url="https://github.com/kunstmusik/blue/releases">here</ulink>. 
      For OSX users, download the DMG file which contains a Blue.app.  You can 
      double-click the Application to run, as well as copy it to your 
      Applications folder to install it.</para>

    <para> 
      For Linux and Windows users, download the ZIP file and unzip it.  Inside
      of the bin folder you will see a "blue" script for Linux or a
      "blue64.exe" file for use on Windows. (A 32-bit version, "blue.exe", is
      also included for those using an older version of Csound that is compiled
      for 32-bit Windows.)</para>

    <para>
      Note: After starting Blue, you may want to explore the example projects
      and pieces found in the Blue/example folder (or right-click and explore
      contents of Blue.app/example if on OSX).

          Blue uses the right mouse click often to show popup menus. If you do

          For 64-bit systems, you may run into issues when running Blue with
          the API enabled where modifying widget values is not reflected in
          performance. This is likely due to the Csound Java API being compiled
          with SWIG &lt; 2.0. For example, some older versions of Csound in
          Debian for amd64 is compiled with SWIG 1.3.0 and does not work with
          Blue.  To work around this, you can install a newer version of Csound
          if available (i.e. from a testing repo), or compile Csound yourself
          and ensure you are using SWIG version 2.0 or greater.

    <para>
      Blue is able to interact with Csound either by calling Csound like a 
      command-line program (classic Blue), or by directly interacting with 
      Csound via the Csound API. Instructions on setting up Blue for each 
      method is described below as well as discussion on benefits and 
      limitations.
    </para>
    
    <section id="commandLineCsound">
      <title>Using Blue with command-line Csound</title>  
        
      <para>
        This may be considered "classical" Blue usage and interaction with 
        Csound as this was the method by which Blue ran with Csound for the 
        first eight years in existance.  The way Blue operates in this mode is 
        by rendering the .Blue project into a temporary CSD file on disk, then
        calling Csound with that temporary CSD file in the same way as if you 
        were on a command-line shell and executing Csound yourself with that
        file.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The benefit to this mode of Csound usage is that it is easier to switch
        out your version of Csound or use multiple versions of Csound on the 
        same computer.  It is also a little more stable than using the API in 
        that if Csound crashes for some reason, it won't take down Blue with it.
        Also, it may be more performant to use the command-line mode.  These
        benefits however need to be weighed against the benefits of using the 
        API, which is described below.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To use the command-line version, one needs to set up the Csound 
        executable option for Realtime and Disk Render settings in

      <title>Using Blue with the Csound API</title>
    
      <para>
        Enabling Blue to use the Csound API when rendering with Csound opens up
        the ability to manipulate and edit widget values and automations
        in realtime during a render, as well as the ability to use BlueLive on 
        Windows.  Because of its enhancement to the user-experience while 
        rendering and composing, it is now the preferred method of using Blue
        with Csound.  Blue should work out-of-the-box with the API if Csound is
        installed using the installers provided on Github, or installed
        via a package manager if on Linux.  
      </para>
      
      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <para>Blue currently
        only works with the API if the version of Csound used is compiled
        using 64-bit doubles.  (The float version is not currently supported 
        when using the API.)  There are technical difficulties in supporting
        two different versions of Csound API in the same build and it is not
        known if or when the float build will be supported.  For users 
        interested in using the float build of Csound with Blue, you will need
        to run Blue using the command-line Csound mode.</para>

        <para>Additionally, the architecture that Csound is compiled for must 
          match the architecture of the Java runtime you are using. For example,
          on Windows, Csound is currently only built for x86_64/amd64 CPU (i.e. 
          64-bit Windows) and not x86  (i.e. 32-bit Windows). In this 
          case, you will need to run Blue using a 64-bit Java Runtime. For OSX,
          this is not an issue as Csound is compiled as a universal binary for
          both i386 and x86_64. On Linux, it is likely that the version of 
          Csound you install/compile and the Java Runtime that you install will
          likely be the same, but if the API does not show as available it may
          be something to check.

      <para>
        The Java API for Csound is split into two parts: the csnd6.jar file as 
        well as the lib_jcsound6.so native library (this file is called
        _jcsound6.dll on Windows, and lib_jcsound6.jnilib on Mac OSX). Blue comes 
        with its own copy of csnd6.jar; to use the API from Blue it will need 
        to have access to the native library to work. If the API is not enabled
        for use out-of-the-box, the following explains how to setup the API on 
        different platforms.

      <simplesect>
        <title>Windows</title>
        
        <para>Users using the Windows Installer for Csound should use the 
          double precision version from Github. (This is the default.) After 
          installing, the installer should setup everything such that Blue 
          should work with the API. If for some reason it is unable to do so, or 
          you have compiled Csound yourself and the location of jcsound6.dll is 
          different from where it is installed with the installer, you can 
          modify the Blue/etc/Blue.conf file to tell Blue where to find the 
          _jcsound6.dll. For example, if the directory where jcsound6.dll is 
          located is in c:\myCsound, open up Blue/etc/Blue.conf and modify the 
          default so that it contains:

        <title>Linux</title>
        
        <para>
          Linux users should install a doubles version of Csound. The version of 
          Csound found in package repositories should be one compiled for 
          doubles. After installing Csound and the Java interface for Csound,
          locate where lib_jcsound6.so is and modify the Blue/bin/Blue file. 
          Search for the lines that contain "-J-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni"
          and modify /usr/lib/jni (the default for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems)
          to the directory where lib_jcsound.so is located.

        <title>Mac OSX</title>
        
        <para>Mac OSX users should use the installer for Csound from 
          Github. The installer should install both the float and doubles 
          version of Csound. The lib_jcsound.jnilib will be installed into
          /Library/Java/Extensions.  If you are compiling your own version of 
          Csound, you can remove the symlink in /Library/Java/Extensions and 
          either symlink your your version there or copy it into that folder.

        <title>Checking the API is Enabled</title>
        
        <para>
          To check if the API is enabled, open Blue and open up the Program
          Options. This is available from the Blue->Preferences menu option on
          OSX, and from the Tools->Options menu option Windows and Linux. In
          the Blue tab, under both Disk and Realtime Render settings, there is
          an option called "Render Method".  If Csound 6 is availble on your
          system and Blue was able to find it, it will show a "Csound 6 API"
          option. If the Csound 6 Java API could be loaded, you will only have
          the "Commandline Runner" option which is always available.</para>
