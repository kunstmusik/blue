<title>About Blue</title>

<para>
  Blue is a music composition environment for use with Csound. Blue interacts
  with Csound by generating .CSD files, which it then feeds to Csound for
  compilation. Any version of Csound that can be called by commandline is able
  to be used with Blue.
</para>
         
<para>
  One of Blue's main features is the graphical timeline of SoundObjects, of
  which a special SoundObject-the polyObject-is able to group other
  SoundObjects. polyObjects feature their own timeline, allowing for timelines
  within timelines. SoundObjects can be anything that generates notes, be it a
  block of Csound SCO, a script in python, or a graphical object.
</para>
         
<para>
  SoundObjects may further have noteProcessors added to them, which may do
  things like "add .3 to all p4 values" or "of these notes, only generate the
  first three". NoteProcessors are especially useful when used with Instance
  SoundObjects from the SoundObject Library.
</para>
         
<para>
  The SoundObject library allows for working with SoundObjects by making
  instances of a SoundObject. Instances point to a SoundObject, and when they
  generate notes, they use the SoundObject they are pointing to to generate the
  notes for them. Instances however can have their own properties which they
  will apply to the generated notes, so that they can be of different duration
  and have different start times, as well as have different noteProcessors used
  with them. the advante of instances versus manually copying a SoundObject over
  and over again is that if you want to change the notes for all of these
  SoundObjects, you'd have to manually go and change all of them, while with
  instances, you'd only have to change the one SoundObject all of the instances
  are pointing to. (which also means you could make a song template file, all
  pointing to empty SoundObjects, build the form of the piece, then change the
  SoundObject's note material to "fill in the form".)
</para>
         
<para>
  Other features include the orchestra manager, which allows for importing of
  instruments from .CSD files, a list to manage instruments, and the ability to
  selectively generate instruments when compiling .CSD files. instruments can be
  either a single Csound instrument or may be a GUI instrument.

<para>
  I have often described Blue as a music composition environment and would like
  to explain what that means to me as well as how it compares to other music
  composition environments.
