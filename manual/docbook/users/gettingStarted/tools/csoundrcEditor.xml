  <para>The .csoundrc Editor tool allows for editing the system-wide .csoundrc 
    file. The editor is accessible from the Tools menu and launching it will 
    open up the file pointed to by the environment variable CSOUNDRC or search 
    for the file in $HOME/.csoundrc. If neither is found, the editor will open 
    up with a file pointing to $HOME/.csoundrc.

Pressing the Save button will save the contents and close the dialog, and pressing the Close button will close the dialog without changes.</para>
