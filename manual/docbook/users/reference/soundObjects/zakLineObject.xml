  <para>Use the left panel to select a line by clicking on the row describing
  the line you wish to edit; you'll know which one is select by the edit points
  showing up in the right panel showing the line. To edit the color of the line,
  double click in the left panel on the color box to the left of the "Zak
  Channel" column. A color selection dialog will appear for the user to choose
  their desired color.</para>

  <para>Enter the zak channel that you whish the signal to be written to under
  the "Zak Channel" column. The "min" and "max" columns define the min and max
  values of the graph that the line is drawn in to the right. However, the min
  and max values can be different on a per-line basis.</para>

  <para>When editing the line in the right panel, left clicking adds a point at
  the current cursor position. Right-clicking will delete a point when a point
  is under the cursor (you can easilly tell this because the a point will change
  to red when the cursor is hovering over it). You can move a point by
  left-clicking and dragging.</para>
