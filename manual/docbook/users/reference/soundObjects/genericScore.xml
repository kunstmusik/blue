  <title>GenericScore </title>
         
  <para>Accepts NoteProcessors: yes</para>
         
  <para>Contains a block of Csound score text. The objective time within the GenericScore starts at time 0, and notes within the genericScore are written relative to 0. The start time of the GenericScore object within the timeline will translate the score text's time, and the SoundObject's time behavior will determine how the notes are processed relative to the GenericScore's duration. For example, for the following score:
  </para>
  
  <screen>i1 0 1 2 3 4 5
i1 1 1 2 3 4 5
i1 2 1 2 3 4 5
  </screen>
         
   <para>
     If this SoundObject is moved to start at time 2.0 with duration 6.0, the generated score will be:
   </para>
  
  <screen>i1 2 2 2 3 4 5
i1 4 2 2 3 4 5
i1 6 2 2 3 4 5
  </screen>

  <note>
    <title>Note</title>

    <para>Score blocks support only a subset of the Csound Score Syntax. Using
      "+" in p2 and "." in pfields, as well as "&lt;" and "&gt;" is supported.
    </para>
