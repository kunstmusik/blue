<title>Equals Processor</title>
         
<para>Parameters: pfield, value</para>
         
<para>Sets user-given pField of all notes in soundObject to user-given value,
i.e. set all p4's to value "440", or set all p6's to value
"/work/audio/wav/mySample2.wav".  The following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 8.00
i1 + . 8.04
i1 + . 8.07
i1 + . 9.00    
</programlisting>

<para>If used with an EqualsProcessor with value 7.00 and pfield 4, would result
in the following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0.0	0.5	7.00
i1	0.5	0.5	7.00
i1	1.0	0.5	7.00
i1	1.5	0.5	7.00
</programlisting>

<para>(The p2 and p3 times above are post-processing for a 2 second duration
soundObject with time behavior or scale.)</para> 


<para>
Tip: One can use this noteProcessor to quickly try reassigning a score to another 
instrument to test what that would sound like by reassigning p1.
