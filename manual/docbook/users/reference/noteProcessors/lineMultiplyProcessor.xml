<para>Parameters: pfield, LineMultiply String</para>
         
<para>The LineMultiply Processor multiplies values in a user-defined pfield.
This noteProcessor differs from the Multiply Processor in that the value
muliplied by is variable over time. The LineMultiply String is a set of
beat/value pairs that are like the breakpoints on curve. The following score:</para>
        
<programlisting>
i1 0 2 80
i1 + . 80
i1 + . 80
i1 + . 80
</programlisting>

<para>
    If processed with a LineMultiple Processor with LineMultiplyString set 
    to "0 0 6 2" and pfield set to 4, would result in:
</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0.0	0.5	0.0
i1	0.5	0.5	53.333336
i1	1.0	0.5	106.66667
i1	1.5	0.5	160.0
</programlisting>

<para>(The p2 and p3 times above are post-processing for a 2 second duration
soundObject with time behavior or scale.)</para> 

<para>
    The LineMultiplyString can be interpreted to mean: start at beat 0 with value 0,
    and by beat 6, arrive at value 2.  For each note, the LineMultiplyString will
    find the note's beat and compare against the LineMultiplyString to see how much
    should be multiplied.  The user should be careful to remember that 
    SoundObjects do not apply scaling of score until after processing with
    noteProcessors.  Therefore, the beat values given in the LineMultiplyString were
    to be applied against the beat values of the original score.
