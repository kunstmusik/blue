\chapter*{Preface}
\label{preface}

Blue is my tool for composing with Csound. I originally created it for
its ability to organize SoundObjects in time as well as to organize and
automate the more mundane tasks that I've found in working with Csound.
It's here to make working with Csound a more enjoyable and focused
experience.

As the program develops over time I am finding more ways to make the
user experience intuitive and the program faster to work with, as well
as finding interesting new things to create to further the capacity for
musical expression. The program's architecture is designed to be as open
as possible in both things the user can do within Blue itself as well as
the ability to expand Blue through the creation of plugins, and by
taking advantage of both one can find many ways to create and shape
musical ideas.

Beyond my own ideas on where to go with Blue, user feedback has also
greatly shaped the direction and richness of the program. Please feel
free to email me anytime with feedback, or join the Blue mailing list
and discuss your ideas and thoughts there.
