\section{Auditioning SoundObjects}\label{auditionSoundObjects}

You are able to quickly audition individual SoundObjects or groups of
SoundObjects on the timeline. This can be very useful to test out single
SoundObject ideas or see how a few different SoundObjects sound together
without having to mute/solo different SoundLayers. To use this feature,
select desired SoundObjects for testing, right-click on a selected
SoundObject, and from the SoundObject popup menu choose "Audition
SoundObjects". You can also initiate the audition by using the
ctrl-shift-a shortcut or by going to the Project menu and choosing
"Audition Selected SoundObjects". To stop auditioning, click anywhere on
the Score timeline.
