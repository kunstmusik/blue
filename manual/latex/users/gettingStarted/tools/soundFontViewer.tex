The Sound Font Viewer allows you to select SoundFonts from the file
selection panel (on the left) and get a listing of the instruments and
presets within that SoundFont.

To use, navigate using the file selection panel and double-click on a
SoundFont. After processing is complete, the tables on the right side
will be populated with a listing of instruments and presets held within
that SoundFont.
