The .csoundrc Editor tool allows for editing the system-wide .csoundrc
file. The editor is accessible from the Tools menu and launching it will
open up the file pointed to by the environment variable CSOUNDRC or
search for the file in \$HOME/.csoundrc. If neither is found, the editor
will open up with a file pointing to \$HOME/.csoundrc.

When the dialog opens, the contents (if a file is found) is shown to
edit in a simple text area. The absolute path of the file found is shown
in the bottom left hand side. Pressing the Save button will save the
contents and close the dialog, and pressing the Close button will close
the dialog without changes.
