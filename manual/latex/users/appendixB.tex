0.124.3 & Previously, if a BSBObject was set to have "Automation
Allowed" but was not itself automated, it would compile as a constant in
the generated CSD. As of 0.124.3, if a widget is made to allow
automation, the Csound code that uses the widget value must accept a
k-rate signal, whether the API is used or not.

If you have a project that rendered fine before 0.124.3 but afterwards
can not render due to problems with Csound complaining that "k-rate
signals not allowed", then you will need to either set the problematic
widgets to not allow automation or change the Csound code so that it
will work with the generated k-rate signal.\tabularnewline
