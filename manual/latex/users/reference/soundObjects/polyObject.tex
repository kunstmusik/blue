\textbf{Tip}

On the root timeline, rt-click on a soundLayer and select "Add new
PolyObject". You should have added a new PolyObject to the timeline. Now
either double-click or rt-click on the PolyObject and select "Edit
SoundObject". You should now be within the PolyObjects timeline, and the
button which says {[}root{]} should now have another button next to it
that says {[}PolyObject{]}. Now try adding a few soundLayers and a few
GenericScore Objects. Now click on {[}root{]}. You have now returned to
the root timeline. Here you should see the PolyObject you've edited. Now
you can scale the object you've created and all of the objects held
within will scale together as a group.
