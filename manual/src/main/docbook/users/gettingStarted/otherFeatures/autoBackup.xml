  <title>AutoBackup and Recovery</title>
    
  <para>Temporary backups of open projects are generated every
    minute for projects which have previously been saved to disk (new projects 
    not yet saved are not backed up).  If Blue quits unexpectedly, those files will remain, 
    otherwise on normal closing of the file they are deleted.  If on
    opening a file a backup if found with a date newer than the original
    file, the option to open from the backup or the original is given.  
  </para>
            
  <para>            
    If the backup is chosen, it is required to use "Save As" to save 
    over the original file or to a new file.  At that point the backup 
    is deleted.  
  </para>

  <para>      
    If the original file is chosen, then the backup file will be 
    overwritten the next time the autobackup thread runs.
